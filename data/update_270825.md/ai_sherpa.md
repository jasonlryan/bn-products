What our clients say
“Having Antony as my AI Sherpa has been invaluable. He’s a trusted partner who helps me navigate the fast-moving AI landscape with clarity and confidence. His advice is both strategic and practical — and having that long-term perspective means I can focus on the big picture while still making smart day-to-day decisions.”

What about…?
Too much commitment? The retainer is flexible — we scale up or down depending on what you need.

Not technical enough? This isn’t about coding — it’s about strategy, leadership and smart application of AI.
