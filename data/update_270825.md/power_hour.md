Hands-on learning: Not theory, but practical problem-solving with real tools.

Tailored to you: We work on your challenge, not a case study.

Immediate value: Leave with a workflow and documented next steps.

Low risk, high return: At £300, it’s the easiest way to explore what AI can do for you — and how we can help further.

How it works
Before the session
You tell us your challenge.

We ask for any documents or data you want to use.

Together we define the objective: go as far as possible in the time.

During the session (1 hour)
Problem statement – Define the challenge and the gap between current and desired outcome.

Task breakdown – Break into actionable steps with tools like ChatGPT or Goblin Tools.

Design a workflow – Build, test and refine using AI (e.g. Gamma, Claude).

After the session
A written summary of your problem statement and workflow.

Tailored resources and further reading.

Clear next steps to keep momentum.
