AI Market Intelligence Dashboard
Turn data into marketing intelligence.
The AI Market Intelligence Dashboard turns online conversations into actionable insight. It scans reviews, forums, and social feeds to show what people really think â€” about your products, competitors and what matters most. Use it for a single campaign, an entire market, or set it to update continuously for always-on intelligence. With an interactive dashboard and AI chatbot, youâ€™ll see sentiment, signals and trends in seconds.
ðŸ‘‰ From Â£12,000. Packages scale from single campaigns to multi-market tracking.

### Section 5: What about...?

- **Too complex?** Designed for marketers â€” intuitive dashboards and chatbot, not dense reports.
