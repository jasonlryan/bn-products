We'll also assume that we're targeting companies with more than 50 employees, as they are more likely to have the roles (high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads) that would benefit from AI Power Hour.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how we could calculate the TAM:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Target Companies in the UK:** According to the Office for National Statistics, there were about 27,000 businesses with 50 or more employees in the UK in 2020 (excluding the public sector). \n\n2. **Estimate the Number of Potential Customers per Company:** Let's assume each of these companies has five employees (CEO, CIO, CMO, Head of Customer Experience, and a Team Lead) who would be interested in AI Power Hour. This is a conservative estimate given larger companies will likely have multiple functional heads and team leads who could benefit from the product.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Potential Customers:** Multiply the number of target companies by the estimated number of potential customers per company. \n\n   Total Potential Customers = Number of Target Companies * Potential Customers per Company \n   = 27,000 companies * 5 potential customers per company \n   = 135,000 potential customers\n\n4. **Estimate the Revenue per Customer:** This is the price of AI Power Hour, which is £300.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Multiply the total number of potential customers by the revenue per customer.\n\n   TAM = Total Potential Customers * Revenue per Customer \n   = 135,000 potential customers * £300 per customer \n   = £40,500,000\n\nSo, based on these assumptions, the TAM for AI Power Hour in the UK market is approximately £40.5 million. \n\nPlease note that this is a simplified approach to estimating the TAM. It's based on a number of assumptions and doesn't take into account factors like market penetration rate, growth rate, or competitive landscape.

This investment will help us capture a larger share of the growing AI education market.\n\n**Slide 9: Closing Statement**\nAI Power Hour is more than just a coaching session - it's a catalyst for change and a tool for empowerment. With your investment, we can help more leaders harness the power of AI, driving transformation, innovation, and growth in their organizations. Together, we can shape a future where AI is leveraged to its fullest potential.\n\nNote: The actual investor deck would be a visual representation of this information, using engaging graphics, charts, and diagrams to illustrate key points.\n\n---\n\n## Context Used\n- Product data from CSV\n- Previous outputs: 11 prior prompts\n\n**Generated on:** 2025-06-10 12:31:55\n"

Despite the evident potential of AI, a significant number of organizations, especially medium to large enterprises, are grappling with the challenge of embracing and integrating AI into their operations. This is largely due to a lack of in-house AI expertise and a daunting knowledge gap around AI.\n\n**Audience**\n\nOur primary audience is medium to large enterprises, ranging from 150 to 500+ employees. These organizations are enthusiastic about AI and understand the potential benefits it can bring to their business. However, they lack the required AI literacy across departments and are in dire need of an effective AI strategy. They value employee development and have a dedicated training budget to build their in-house expertise.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAI-B-C™ is a comprehensive AI capability-building product designed to fast-track organization-wide AI adoption and build in-house AI expertise across all levels.

It should be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to the various roles within an organization, from executive leadership to IT managers. Given the diverse audience, the UI should be accessible and inclusive, using clear language and visual cues to guide users through the platform.\n\n**1. Welcome Screen**\n\nThis is the first screen users will encounter. It should feature a clear and concise overview of AI-B-C™, its mission, and its offerings. A clear call-to-action (CTA) to \"Get Started\" should be prominently displayed. The design should be clean, with a modern color palette that reflects AI-B-C™'s brand identity. The use of imagery related to AI, such as neural networks or data visualizations, could also help set the tone.\n\n**2. Assessment Screen**\n\nThis screen will be used to gather information about the organization's current AI maturity level and specific learning needs. It should include a simple, intuitive form or questionnaire. The design should guide the user through each question, using visual cues to indicate progress and next steps. The language should be clear, avoiding jargon, and ensuring all users, regardless of their current AI knowledge, can understand and complete the assessment.\n\n**3. Custom Learning Plan Screen**\n\nThis screen will showcase the custom learning plan tailored to the organization's needs. It should clearly present the different modules or sections of the learning plan, and provide a brief overview of each. Interactive elements, such as expandable sections for more detail, could be used to keep the screen uncluttered. The overall design should inspire excitement and anticipation for the learning journey ahead.\n\n**4. Workshop/Webinar Screen**\n\nThis screen will host the expert-led workshops and webinars. It should include video and chat functionalities for interactive sessions. A clear structure, showing the agenda or key points for each session, should be included. The design should promote engagement and interaction, with clear CTAs for asking questions or providing feedback.\n\n**5. Progress Assessment Screen**\n\nThis screen will provide users with an overview of their progress throughout the learning program. Visual representations, such as progress bars or charts, could be used to display progress in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. The design should be encouraging, highlighting achievements and areas of improvement.\n\n**6. Resource Screen**\n\nThis screen will provide access to additional learning resources, such as articles, guides, and case studies. The design should be clean and organized, allowing users to easily navigate and find resources relevant to their interests or needs.\n\nIn terms of style, use a modern and professional font, such as Roboto or Arial, that is easy to read. The color scheme should reflect the brand identity of AI-B-C™, possibly incorporating blues and greys to symbolize trust and intelligence, coupled with brighter accent colors for CTAs and highlights. Use imagery and icons sparingly but strategically, to aid in navigation and comprehension. Lastly, ensure the UI is responsive to cater to users accessing the platform on different devices.\n\n---",

            "Generated Output": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI-B-C™, we will use the top-down approach. This approach starts with the total market and then narrows it down to the segment that AI-B-C™ can serve.\n\n**Step 1: Total Market Size**\n\nTo define the total market, we need to consider the total number of medium to large enterprises in the United Kingdom, as this is the primary target audience for AI-B-C™. According to the UK government's business population estimates for 2021, there are approximately 40,500 medium-sized businesses (with 50-249 employees) and 8,000 large businesses (with 250+ employees). If we add these, we get 48,500 businesses. \n\n**Step 2: Market Segmentation**\n\nAI-B-C™ is specifically designed for organizations that are enthusiastic about AI but lack in-house expertise. According to a report by McKinsey, about 20% of businesses in the UK have started adopting AI in some form. So we can assume that these organizations are enthusiastic about AI. This gives us 20% of 48,500, which is 9,700 businesses.\n\n**Step 3: Budget Considerations**\n\nAI-B-C™ is not a cheap product, and only companies with a dedicated training budget can afford it. According to a report by Training Journal, approximately 85% of medium to large businesses in the UK have a dedicated training budget. Applying this percentage to the 9,700 businesses gives us 8,245 businesses.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Addressable Market (TAM)**\n\nThe TAM can be calculated by multiplying the number of potential customers (8,245 businesses) by the average revenue per user (ARPU). \n\nIf we consider the mid-tier product option (one day AI Acceleration team day) priced at £8,800 as the most likely product choice for these businesses, the TAM would be:\n\n8,245 businesses * £8,800 = £72,556,000\n\nTherefore, the estimated Total Addressable Market for AI-B-C™ in the UK, based on these assumptions, is approximately £72.56 million.\n\nIt's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and actual market conditions can vary. Also, this estimation only considers the UK market. The TAM would be significantly larger if other markets were also considered.\n\n---",

            "Generated Output": "Certainly! Below are eight tough investor questions pertaining to the AI Innovation Programme, along with crisp, confident answers that reflect a deep understanding of the product's value proposition and market context.\n\n### 1. **What differentiates your AI Innovation Programme from competitors like IBM Garage?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nWhile IBM Garage offers a collaborative approach to AI application development, our AI Innovation Programme focuses specifically on creating a customized innovation process tailored to each client. We provide hands-on workshops, rapid prototyping, and integration strategies that are uniquely designed to fit the existing R&D framework of our clients. Moreover, our emphasis on continuous experimentation and metrics tracking ensures that clients not only innovate but also measure the tangible impact of their AI initiatives.\n\n### 2. **How do you justify the bespoke pricing of the AI Innovation Programme?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe bespoke pricing reflects the tailored nature of our service, which is designed to meet the specific needs and challenges of each client. We conduct a thorough assessment of their existing capabilities and innovation goals, allowing us to create a highly customized package that maximizes ROI. Additionally, the potential for breakthrough innovation and process improvement can lead to significant cost savings and revenue generation, making the investment worthwhile.\n\n### 3. **What metrics will you use to evaluate the success of the AI Innovation Programme?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nWe will implement a comprehensive metrics and evaluation framework that includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as innovation throughput (number of ideas generated and validated), time-to-market for AI solutions, cost savings achieved through process improvements, and revenue growth attributed to new AI-driven products. Regular reviews and adjustments based on these metrics will ensure that clients can continuously refine their innovation strategies.\n\n### 4. **Can you provide examples of successful outcomes from previous clients or pilot projects?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nCertainly! In recent pilot projects, clients have seen a 30% reduction in time-to-market for new products after implementing our rapid prototyping workshops. Another client increased their innovation pipeline by 50% by integrating our customized ideation processes into their R&D efforts. These successes not only validate our approach but also showcase the tangible benefits companies can expect from our programme.\n\n### 5. **What steps do you take to ensure that clients are ready for AI integration?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nWe conduct a thorough readiness assessment that evaluates the client’s current AI maturity, existing technological infrastructure, and organizational culture. Based on these insights, we provide tailored recommendations and support to enhance their readiness. This may include training sessions for staff, adjustments to workflows, and the establishment of a dedicated innovation team to ensure successful AI integration.\n\n### 6. **How do you plan to scale the AI Innovation Programme to meet increasing demand?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nScalability is built into our programme through a modular design. Our workshops, consultancy sessions, and prototyping frameworks can be easily replicated across different client engagements. Additionally, we plan to develop a network of certified facilitators who can deliver our workshops, ensuring that we can meet growing demand without compromising quality. Strategic partnerships with academic institutions and technology providers will also enhance our capacity.\n\n### 7. **What is your long-term vision for the AI Innovation Programme?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nOur long-term vision is to establish the AI Innovation Programme as the leading framework for AI-driven innovation in the medium to large enterprise sector. We aim to continuously refine our offerings based on emerging AI technologies and market needs, ultimately creating a community of innovation leaders who share best practices and collaborate on AI initiatives. This will position us as thought leaders in the AI consultancy space.\n\n### 8. **How do you address the potential risks associated with AI experimentation?**\n\n**Answer:**  \nWe understand that AI experimentation carries inherent risks, which is why our programme emphasizes a structured approach to innovation. We advocate for a ‘fail fast, learn faster’ mentality, where experiments are designed with clear success criteria and fallback plans. Our expert consultants guide clients in identifying potential risks, ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines, and implementing robust data governance practices to mitigate risks associated with AI deployment.\n\nThese responses not only address the concerns of potential investors but also reflect a strategic understanding of the market, the product's unique value proposition, and the thoughtful planning that underpins the AI Innovation Programme’s success.\n\n---",

Regular strategy reviews allow us to adjust initiatives based on performance and external changes, ensuring ongoing alignment and risk management.\n\n7. **Question:** What is your customer acquisition strategy for this service?\n\n   **Answer:** Our customer acquisition strategy focuses on targeted outreach to decision-makers in large enterprises and high-growth scale-ups that recognize the importance of AI.

            "Generated Output": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service, we can use the top-down market sizing approach. This involves identifying a larger market that we are part of, and then narrowing it down based on the proportion of the market that our service caters to.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Larger Market**\n\nOur service is part of the larger AI consulting market. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI consulting market size was valued at USD 6.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% from 2021 to 2028. \n\n**Step 2: Narrow Down Based on Geographical Reach**\n\nLet's assume our service is initially targeting clients in the United States. According to the same report, North America accounted for the largest share of the AI consulting market, with 40% of the total market in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the size of the AI consulting market in the United States in 2020 was approximately $2.56 billion (40% of $6.4 billion).\n\n**Step 3: Narrow Down Based on Client Size**\n\nOur ideal client is a large enterprise or a fast-growing scale-up. According to data from the US Small Business Administration, large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups account for about 50% of the total number of businesses in the US.\n\nTherefore, the size of our TAM in terms of client size is approximately $1.28 billion (50% of $2.56 billion).\n\n**Step 4: Narrow Down Based on AI Maturity**\n\nOur service is ideally suited to organizations with a low to medium AI maturity level. Based on a report by McKinsey, approximately 70% of businesses are still in the early stages of AI maturity.\n\nTherefore, the size of our TAM in terms of AI maturity is approximately $0.896 billion (70% of $1.28 billion).\n\n**Step 5: Narrow Down Based on Attitude Towards AI**\n\nOur service targets organizations that view AI as a strategic imperative. According to a survey by Gartner, around 60% of organizations view AI as a strategic imperative.\n\nTherefore, the final TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service is approximately $0.538 billion (60% of $0.896 billion).\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service in the United States is approximately $538 million.\n\nThis is a rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors. For a more precise estimate, we would need more specific data on the number of large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups in the US that view AI as a strategic imperative and are in the early stages of AI maturity.\n\n---",

            "Generated Output": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product, we first need to define the market we're addressing. Given the product's broad applicability across various industries and business sizes, and its global reach, we can define our market as the global market for market research services.\n\nAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global market for market research services was estimated to be $73.4 billion in 2021, and it's projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach $100.2 billion by 2026.\n\nHowever, not all companies within this market will be potential customers for our product. We need to adjust this figure to reflect our specific target market - organizations of any size, operating in fast-moving markets, that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture.\n\nHere's how we can calculate this:\n\n1. **Determine the percentage of businesses operating in fast-moving markets:** Fast-moving markets often include industries such as technology, e-commerce, digital services, and consumer goods. According to IBISWorld, these industries represent approximately 30% of the total global market.\n\n2. **Estimate the percentage of these businesses that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture:** This can be challenging to quantify, but based on various industry reports and surveys, we can conservatively estimate this at around 50%.\n\n3. **Factor in the percentage of these businesses that can afford our product priced at £10,000:** According to data from the World Bank and various industry reports, approximately 60% of businesses in these fast-moving industries could afford such a service.\n\nUsing these percentages, we can calculate our TAM as follows:\n\n$73.4 billion (Global Market Research Services Market) * 30% (Businesses in Fast-Moving Markets) * 50% (Businesses that Value Innovation and Data-Driven Decision Making) * 60% (Businesses that can afford our product) = $6.6 billion\n\nThus, based on these estimates, the Total Addressable Market for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product would be around $6.6 billion. \n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and actual figures may vary. Further research and analysis would be needed to refine these numbers.\n\n---",

This includes:\n\n1. Access to relevant stakeholders and team members for consultations, coaching, workshops, and strategy sessions.\n2. Information sharing about the organisation's current capabilities, technology infrastructure, business goals, AI expectations, and readiness level for AI transformation.\n3. Regular feedback, collaboration, and open communication channels to facilitate ongoing strategy refinement and progress reporting.\n\n**Process:**\nOnce the inputs are received, the following steps are followed:\n\n1. Initial Assessment: Conduct an initial review of the client's AI readiness level, existing capabilities, and business goals.\n2. Customised Coaching/Advisory Sessions: Schedule sessions with key stakeholders to provide expert advice on AI strategy, adoption, and innovation.\n3.

The service does not cover the actual development or full implementation of AI tools or systems. It primarily focuses on strategy, coaching, and supporting the client's team in adopting AI.\n3. The measurable impact of AI on the business might not be immediately visible as it often requires time for full-scale implementation and adoption.\n4. The service requires a long-term investment, and it might not be suitable for organisations looking for quick, short-term fixes.\n5. The service does not guarantee specific business outcomes as they can be influenced by various factors beyond the scope of the service, such as market conditions, business model, or organisational culture.\n\n---",

This includes:\n\n1. Access to relevant stakeholders and team members for consultations, coaching, workshops, and strategy sessions.\n2. Information sharing about the organisation's current capabilities, technology infrastructure, business goals, AI expectations, and readiness level for AI transformation.\n3. Regular feedback, collaboration, and open communication channels to facilitate ongoing strategy refinement and progress reporting.\n\n**Process:**\nOnce the inputs are received, the following steps are followed:\n\n1. Initial Assessment: Conduct an initial review of the client's AI readiness level, existing capabilities, and business goals.\n2. Customised Coaching/Advisory Sessions: Schedule sessions with key stakeholders to provide expert advice on AI strategy, adoption, and innovation.\n3.

The service does not cover the actual development or full implementation of AI tools or systems. It primarily focuses on strategy, coaching, and supporting the client's team in adopting AI.\n3. The measurable impact of AI on the business might not be immediately visible as it often requires time for full-scale implementation and adoption.\n4. The service requires a long-term investment, and it might not be suitable for organisations looking for quick, short-term fixes.\n5. The service does not guarantee specific business outcomes as they can be influenced by various factors beyond the scope of the service, such as market conditions, business model, or organisational culture.\n\n---\n\n## Context Used\n- Product data from CSV\n- Previous outputs: 1 prior prompts\n\n**Generated on:** 2025-06-10 12:53:20\n"

            "Generated Output": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI Consultancy Retainer service, we need to consider the number of potential customers (established businesses with a significant scale) globally that could benefit from this service, and their potential spending on such services. \n\nHere's a step-by-step process on how we can estimate this:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the target customer**\nFrom the product context, we know that our target customers are ambitious, established businesses (often global brands) that want to build sustainable AI capability and maintain a competitive edge. \n\n**Step 2: Estimate the number of target customers**\nGiven that our service is aimed at established, sizable businesses, let's use the number of mid to large companies worldwide as a proxy. According to the OECD, there were around 43,000 large enterprises worldwide in 2017. We can assume this number has grown at a moderate rate of 2% per year, giving us approximately 47,000 large enterprises in 2021.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the potential spending per customer**\nAccording to a report by Statista, the global market for consulting services was worth about $160 billion in 2020. If we assume that 10% of this is spent on AI-related consulting services, that gives us a total spend of $16 billion.

According to the OECD, there were around 43,000 large enterprises worldwide in 2017. We can assume this number has grown at a moderate rate of 2% per year, giving us approximately 47,000 large enterprises in 2021.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the potential spending per customer**\nAccording to a report by Statista, the global market for consulting services was worth about $160 billion in 2020. If we assume that 10% of this is spent on AI-related consulting services, that gives us a total spend of $16 billion. If we divide this by the number of large enterprises worldwide (47,000), we get an average spend per enterprise of approximately $340,000 per year.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the TAM**\nThe TAM would then be the number of target customers multiplied by the potential spending per customer. Therefore, TAM = 47,000 enterprises * $340,000/enterprise = $15.98 billion.\n\n**TAM Equation:**\nTAM = Number of Target Customers * Average Annual Spend per Customer\nTAM = 47,000 * $340,000 = $15.98 billion\n\nPlease note that this is a very rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors, including the specific industries targeted, the readiness of these businesses to adopt AI, the competitive landscape, and market conditions.

            "Generated Output": "Certainly! Below are eight tough investor questions along with crisp, confident answers tailored specifically for the AI Innovation Day product.\n\n### 1. **What is the unique value proposition of AI Innovation Day compared to existing solutions in the market?**\n\n**Answer:** AI Innovation Day offers a unique blend of rapid prototyping, AI-assisted ideation, and tangible outcomes within a single day. Unlike traditional design sprints, which can last several days, our workshop compresses the entire innovation process into an impactful one-day experience. This is particularly valuable for organizations under pressure to innovate quickly, delivering a ready-to-share digital prototype by the end of the workshop. Our focus on hands-on experimentation with no-code tools sets us apart, making AI accessible even for non-technical teams.\n\n### 2. **How will you measure the success of the workshop for both participants and your business?**\n\n**Answer:** Success will be measured through several key performance indicators (KPIs). For participants, we will track immediate outcomes such as participant satisfaction scores, the number of viable prototypes generated, and post-workshop implementation rates. For our business, we will assess the number of repeat bookings, client testimonials, and referrals generated from each session. Additionally, we will monitor engagement metrics and follow-up coaching sessions to gauge long-term impact and client success.\n\n### 3. **What are the main challenges you anticipate in delivering this product, and how will you address them?**\n\n**Answer:** One primary challenge is ensuring that diverse teams can effectively collaborate in a limited timeframe. To address this, we employ experienced facilitators skilled in navigating group dynamics and fostering creativity. Another challenge is the varying levels of AI familiarity among participants. We mitigate this by customizing our pre-workshop materials, ensuring all participants have a foundational understanding of AI tools used during the session. Lastly, we are prepared for potential technical issues by conducting thorough pre-session checks of all tools and platforms involved.\n\n### 4. **What is your strategy for scaling AI Innovation Day beyond initial clients?**\n\n**Answer:** Our scaling strategy includes developing a robust marketing plan targeting medium to large organizations, leveraging case studies from successful workshops as social proof. We will also explore partnerships with industry organizations and innovation hubs to reach a broader audience. Additionally, we plan to create a certification program for facilitators to expand our reach and maintain quality control, allowing us to offer workshops in multiple locations and industries.\n\n### 5. **How do you plan to keep the content of the workshop relevant as AI technology evolves?**\n\n**Answer:** We will establish an advisory board comprising AI experts, industry leaders, and innovation strategists who will provide ongoing insights into emerging trends and technologies. Regular updates to our workshop content will be made to incorporate new tools, methodologies, and best practices. We will also gather feedback from participants after each session to continuously refine and enhance the workshop experience based on real-world applications and evolving AI capabilities.\n\n### 6. **What are your customer acquisition costs, and how do you plan to optimize them?**\n\n**Answer:** Our initial customer acquisition costs (CAC) are projected to be approximately 20% of the workshop price, driven mainly by targeted digital marketing campaigns and networking efforts. To optimize CAC, we will focus on content marketing, leveraging SEO to attract organic traffic, and cultivating partnerships for co-marketing opportunities. Additionally, we will implement referral incentives for past participants, which can significantly lower acquisition costs while promoting word-of-mouth growth.\n\n### 7. **What is your long-term vision for the AI Innovation Day product?**\n\n**Answer:** Our long-term vision is to establish AI Innovation Day as a leading brand in innovation workshops, known for empowering organizations to harness AI effectively. We aim to expand our offerings to include follow-up coaching, tailored innovation ecosystems, and a suite of online resources to support continuous learning. Ultimately, we envision creating a community of innovators who regularly engage with our brand, fostering a culture of experimentation and rapid iteration across industries.\n\n### 8. **How do you plan to handle intellectual property (IP) generated during the workshops?**\n\n**Answer:** We will have clear agreements in place with workshop participants regarding IP ownership. Generally, participants will retain ownership of their ideas and prototypes, while we will maintain the rights to the frameworks, tools, and methodologies developed for the workshop. Additionally, we will explore licensing opportunities for any proprietary tools we create, which could provide an additional revenue stream. Transparency in IP management will be crucial in building trust and encouraging participation in our workshops.\n\n---\n\nThese responses are designed to provide clarity on the product's strengths, strategies, and operational considerations, instilling confidence in potential investors.\n\n---",

These could be found across various industries including Technology, Retail, Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, etc.\n\n2.\t**Average Revenue per Customer:** Our AI Innovation Day is priced at £8,800 per workshop.\n\nTo estimate the TAM, we need to multiply the total number of potential customers by the average revenue per customer, i.e., TAM = Number of Customers * Average Revenue per Customer.\n\nHere are some assumptions that we need to make for our TAM calculation:\n\n1.\t**Market Penetration:** Let’s assume that we can reach 5% of the medium to large organisations in the UK that are actively investing in innovation and exploring AI capabilities. \n2.\t**Customer Composition:** Assume that 10% of these organisations are ‘ideal clients’ as described in the product context.

            "Generated Output": "Certainly, here's how you can approach the UI frames for the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens for the Social Intelligence Dashboard.\n\n**1. Landing Screen: Dashboard Homepage**\n\nThe landing screen should offer a clean and concise overview of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top, it should include links to the main sections: WRI Analysis, Competitor Analysis, Market Research Reports and Settings/Profile. It should also have a company logo that redirects to the homepage when clicked.\n\n- **Summary Card:** This should be a prominent card on the page, displaying the most recent key metrics from the WRI Analysis.\n\n- **Competitor Analysis Preview:** A small chart or graph visualizing a key aspect of the latest competitor analysis.\n\n- **Recent Reports:** Display recent market research reports with their titles, brief descriptions, and a 'View Report' call-to-action button.\n\n- **Notifications:** An area that displays important updates or alerts related to the user's market research.\n\n**2. Main Task Screen: WRI Analysis Page**\n\nThis page is where users engage with the primary function of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Filter Tool:** A tool allowing users to filter the WRI Analysis data by different categories, attributes, or regions.\n\n- **WRI Analysis Chart:** An interactive chart visualizing the scores and rankings of the 20 key product attributes. Users should be able to hover over or click on chart elements to see more detailed data.\n\n- **Attribute Details:** When an attribute in the chart is selected, this area should display more detailed information about the attribute, including its definition, importance, and trend over time.\n\n**3. Success Screen: Market Research Report View**\n\nThe success screen is where users can view a complete market research report. It should include:\n\n- **Report Title:** The report's title at the top of the page.\n\n- **PDF Viewer:** An interactive, searchable PDF viewer displaying the report. It should include standard controls for zooming, scrolling, and navigating pages.\n\n- **Download Button:** A button allowing users to download the report as a PDF.\n\n- **Related Reports:** A section displaying other reports that might be of interest to the user.\n\nFor the design style, maintain a professional, data-centric look throughout. Use bold headline typography for titles and subtitles, and ensure all text is clear and readable. Use rounded components for a modern, friendly feel. For colors, use a neutral color palette for the overall dashboard, with more vibrant colors for charts, graphs, and other key visual elements. Make sure all interactive elements have clear hover and click states to enhance usability.\n\nOverall, the goal is to create a user-friendly interface that makes complex market research data easy to understand and interact with, helping users make informed decisions quickly and effectively.\n\n---",

Landing Screen: Dashboard Homepage**\n\nThe landing screen should offer a clean and concise overview of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top, it should include links to the main sections: WRI Analysis, Competitor Analysis, Market Research Reports and Settings/Profile. It should also have a company logo that redirects to the homepage when clicked.\n\n- **Summary Card:** This should be a prominent card on the page, displaying the most recent key metrics from the WRI Analysis.\n\n- **Competitor Analysis Preview:** A small chart or graph visualizing a key aspect of the latest competitor analysis.\n\n- **Recent Reports:** Display recent market research reports with their titles, brief descriptions, and a 'View Report' call-to-action button.\n\n- **Notifications:** An area that displays important updates or alerts related to the user's market research.\n\n**2. Main Task Screen: WRI Analysis Page**\n\nThis page is where users engage with the primary function of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Filter Tool:** A tool allowing users to filter the WRI Analysis data by different categories, attributes, or regions.\n\n- **WRI Analysis Chart:** An interactive chart visualizing the scores and rankings of the 20 key product attributes. Users should be able to hover over or click on chart elements to see more detailed data.\n\n- **Attribute Details:** When an attribute in the chart is selected, this area should display more detailed information about the attribute, including its definition, importance, and trend over time.\n\n**3. Success Screen: Market Research Report View**\n\nThe success screen is where users can view a complete market research report. It should include:\n\n- **Report Title:** The report's title at the top of the page.\n\n- **PDF Viewer:** An interactive, searchable PDF viewer displaying the report. It should include standard controls for zooming, scrolling, and navigating pages.\n\n- **Download Button:** A button allowing users to download the report as a PDF.\n\n- **Related Reports:** A section displaying other reports that might be of interest to the user.\n\nFor the design style, maintain a professional, data-centric look throughout. Use bold headline typography for titles and subtitles, and ensure all text is clear and readable. Use rounded components for a modern, friendly feel. For colors, use a neutral color palette for the overall dashboard, with more vibrant colors for charts, graphs, and other key visual elements. Make sure all interactive elements have clear hover and click states to enhance usability.\n\nOverall, the goal is to create a user-friendly interface that makes complex market research data easy to understand and interact with, helping users make informed decisions quickly and effectively.\n\n---\n\n## Context Used\n- Product data from CSV\n- Previous outputs: 8 prior prompts\n\n**Generated on:** 2025-06-10 13:06:24\n"

            "Generated Output": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the Social Intelligence Dashboard within the automotive and motorcycle industries, we can use the top-down approach. This method starts with large, macro-level data and progressively narrows it down to the specific market we're interested in. \n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n**Step 1: Overall Market Size**\nFirstly, we need to estimate the overall market size for the automotive and motorcycle industries combined. According to Statista, the global automotive market was worth approximately $2.7 trillion in 2020, and the global motorcycle market was worth around $120 billion in the same year. Combining these, the total global market size for both industries is about $2.82 trillion.\n\n**Step 2: Percentage of Firms with €50M+ Revenue**\nOur target customers are mid to large-sized companies in these industries with €50M+ annual revenue. Unfortunately, exact percentage data for this subset of companies is not readily available. However, we can make an educated assumption. According to data from the European Commission, approximately 1% of companies in the EU can be classified as 'large' (i.e., earning €50M+ in revenue). As a conservative estimate, we'll assume this percentage is applicable globally.\n\n**Step 3: Average Spend on Market Research**\nNext, we need to estimate what percentage of their revenue these companies typically spend on market research. According to a report by Forrester, companies typically allocate around 10% of their revenue on marketing, and around 10% of that marketing budget is spent on market research. So, approximately 1% of a company's revenue might be allocated to market research.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate TAM**\nFinally, we calculate the TAM by applying these percentages to the overall market size.\n\nHere's the equation:\n\n$2.82 trillion (overall market size) X 1% (percentage of firms with €50M+ revenue) X 1% (percentage of revenue spent on market research) = TAM\n\n**Please note:** All these figures are rough estimates and the actual TAM might be different due to various factors. Furthermore, the TAM for the Social Intelligence Dashboard could be even larger if we consider secondary markets such as marketing agencies serving automotive/motorcycle clients, or if we expand the product to serve additional industries in the future.\n\n---",

This method starts with large, macro-level data and progressively narrows it down to the specific market we're interested in. \n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n**Step 1: Overall Market Size**\nFirstly, we need to estimate the overall market size for the automotive and motorcycle industries combined. According to Statista, the global automotive market was worth approximately $2.7 trillion in 2020, and the global motorcycle market was worth around $120 billion in the same year. Combining these, the total global market size for both industries is about $2.82 trillion.\n\n**Step 2: Percentage of Firms with €50M+ Revenue**\nOur target customers are mid to large-sized companies in these industries with €50M+ annual revenue. Unfortunately, exact percentage data for this subset of companies is not readily available. However, we can make an educated assumption. According to data from the European Commission, approximately 1% of companies in the EU can be classified as 'large' (i.e., earning €50M+ in revenue). As a conservative estimate, we'll assume this percentage is applicable globally.\n\n**Step 3: Average Spend on Market Research**\nNext, we need to estimate what percentage of their revenue these companies typically spend on market research. According to a report by Forrester, companies typically allocate around 10% of their revenue on marketing, and around 10% of that marketing budget is spent on market research. So, approximately 1% of a company's revenue might be allocated to market research.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate TAM**\nFinally, we calculate the TAM by applying these percentages to the overall market size.\n\nHere's the equation:\n\n$2.82 trillion (overall market size) X 1% (percentage of firms with €50M+ revenue) X 1% (percentage of revenue spent on market research) = TAM\n\n**Please note:** All these figures are rough estimates and the actual TAM might be different due to various factors. Furthermore, the TAM for the Social Intelligence Dashboard could be even larger if we consider secondary markets such as marketing agencies serving automotive/motorcycle clients, or if we expand the product to serve additional industries in the future.\n\n---\n\n## Context Used\n- Product data from CSV\n- Previous outputs: 5 prior prompts\n\n**Generated on:** 2025-06-10 13:04:36\n"
