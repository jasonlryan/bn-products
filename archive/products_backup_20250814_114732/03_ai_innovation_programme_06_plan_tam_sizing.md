## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our AI Innovation Programme, we need to first identify the number of potential customers (companies) that fit into our ideal customer profile and then multiply it by the average annual revenue we expect to generate from each customer.

Let's break down the TAM calculation:

1. **Potential Customer Base:** Our ideal customer profile includes medium to large companies with dedicated R&D budgets, who are innovation-focused and willing to experiment with AI. These companies are likely in tech, PR, agency landscape, finance, or other AI-amenable industries. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 200,000 businesses in the US with more than 100 employees. Assuming that 20% of these businesses are in our target industries and have a dedicated R&D budget, we get a potential customer base of 40,000 companies.

2. **Average Revenue Per Customer:** The pricing for our AI Innovation Programme is bespoke, but let's assume that the average annual revenue we expect to generate from each customer is $100,000. This figure takes into account the cost of workshops, consultancy, and prototype build package, and is an estimate based on industry standards and our value proposition.

Using these assumptions, we can now calculate the TAM:

TAM = Potential Customer Base x Average Revenue Per Customer
TAM = 40,000 companies x $100,000
TAM = $4 billion

Therefore, the estimated Total Addressable Market for our AI Innovation Programme is $4 billion. 

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate. The actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on factors like the actual percentage of businesses in our target industries that have a dedicated R&D budget, the average revenue we can generate from each customer, and market changes that could affect the number of potential customers or the average revenue per customer.
