## Generated Output

As an AI consultant, I'm afraid I cannot create visual UI frames. However, I can certainly guide you on what key elements and features should be included in the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens based on the product context and previous outputs.

**1. Landing Screen (Home Page)**

This should be the initial screen that users see when visiting your website. The design should be clean, professional, and visually appealing to instantly capture the user's attention.

Key Elements:
- Bold Headline: "Accelerate Decision-Making with AI-Powered Market Intelligence"
- Subheading: "Gain deeper insights faster with our 5-day sprint that produces a creative direction, human truths, and insights to inform your campaign."
- A brief, engaging summary of the product with a focus on benefits (faster insights, access to AI-powered tools, expert analysis, custom reports, strategy recommendations). Use bullet points or short paragraphs for easy readability.
- Call to Action (CTA) Button: "Get Started" or "Start Your Sprint Now"
- Testimonials or success stories from previous clients to build trust.
- Features section: Highlight key features like AI-driven data analysis, sentiment analysis, predictive modeling, competitor analysis, and interactive dashboards.
- Footer: Include links to other pages (e.g., About Us, Pricing, Contact Us), social media icons, and contact information.

**2. Main Task Screen (Dashboard)**

This is the primary interface where users will interact with the product. It should be user-friendly, intuitive, and packed with useful features.

Key Elements:
- User Profile: Display the name and profile picture of the logged-in user.
- Navigation Menu: Include links for Home, Reports, Predictive Modeling, Competitor Analysis, Strategy Recommendations, and Logout.
- Overview Section: Display a summary of key insights and trends in an easy-to-understand format (charts, graphs, etc.).
- Details Section: Users can click on each insight to view more detailed information. Include options to download or share the report.
- Notifications: Show important updates or notifications at the top of the dashboard.
- Help: Include a help button or link to the FAQ section for user assistance.

**3. Success Screen**

This screen should appear once a user has successfully completed a task like generating a report, creating a predictive model, or implementing strategy recommendations.

Key Elements:
- Success Message: "Your report has been generated successfully!" or "Your predictive model is ready!" or "Your strategy recommendations have been implemented!"
- Display a preview or summary of the completed task.
- CTA Button: "View Report" or "View Predictive Model" or "View Strategy Recommendations"
- Option to go back to the dashboard or perform another task.

Remember to maintain consistency in design and typography across all screens. Use bold headline typography and rounded components as instructed. Keep the user journey smooth and logical, ensuring that every element on the screen serves a purpose and enhances usability.
