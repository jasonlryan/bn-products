**Product Manifesto: AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO)**

**Problem:**

In the rapidly evolving world of technology, AI stands at the forefront of innovation and disruption. However, navigating this complex landscape and leveraging AI as a strategic advantage can be challenging for many organisations. This is particularly true for large enterprises and fast-rising scale-ups that may lack the internal expertise and strategic direction to fully utilise AI. They face the risk of falling behind, losing competitive edge, or even facing disruption.

**Audience:**

Our primary audience are large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups that view AI as a strategic imperative. They recognise the potential of AI to drive growth and differentiation, but they may lack the talent or strategic guidance to effectively integrate AI into their business model. They might be in industries facing disruption or seeking to disrupt, and are in need of executive-level AI strategy to navigate these changes.

**Solution:**

Our service, AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO), bridges this gap. We provide regular strategy sessions with AI experts, ongoing advisory services at the executive/board level, and support in AI-related decision making. We assist with AI talent acquisition and development, conduct regular AI capability assessments, and provide roadmap updates. We offer a hands-on approach, guiding organisations in strategic AI leadership and capability development, from skills assessment to ongoing strategy development and regular strategy reviews.

**Magic Moment:**

The magic moment comes when our clients realise the impact of our service - when they witness the transformation of their AI capabilities, from a state of low to medium maturity to a competitive advantage. This is the moment when they see their teams efficiently grasping AI opportunities, when they successfully recruit and develop AI talents, and when they feel confident in their AI-related decision-making. It's the moment they realise they've cut their learning time and are now leading the AI revolution in their industry, no longer fearing disruption but causing it.

**Why Excited:**

We are excited because we are not just offering a service, but a partnership that drives growth and innovation. We are providing our clients with a strategic edge in the AI landscape, equipping them with the necessary tools and strategies to stay ahead. We offer strategic advice without big-tech bias and provide Fractional CAIO access with no delay or risk. We are excited because we are enabling our clients to unlock the full potential of AI, and in doing so, we are shaping the future.
