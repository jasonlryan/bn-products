## Generated Output

Given the detailed context and requirements for your product, here's how I visualize the design and functionality for the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens of the AI Power Hour platform:

**1. Landing Screen:**

The landing screen will be the first point of interaction with the users. It should be designed to provide a clear understanding of AI Power Hour, its benefits, and its target audience.

- **Design:**
  - Use a bold headline typography like "Unleash AI's Potential With Personalized Learning" to immediately grab attention.
  - Follow with a concise explanation of the product and its benefits.
  - Include visuals or icons emphasizing key features - personalized guidance, real-world solutions, improved AI literacy.
  - Use a color scheme of blues and whites for a clean, professional look.
  - Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) button like "Book Your Session Now" in a contrasting color to make it stand out.

- **Functionality:**
  - The CTA button should direct users to the booking process page.
  - A menu or navigation bar should be present for users to explore more about the product, FAQ, contact information, etc.

**2. Main Task Screen:**

The main task screen is where users will book their session and provide information about their role and AI-related needs. The design should be intuitive and designed for easy information input.

- **Design:**
  - Use form fields or dropdown menus for users to input their information.
  - Include fields for date and time selection for the session.
  - Add a section for users to describe their specific AI-related task or challenge.
  - Include a "Proceed to Payment" button after all necessary information is filled.

- **Functionality:**
  - The date and time field should provide a calendar view for easy selection.
  - The specific task/challenge field can have prompt text to guide users in providing required information.
  - The "Proceed to Payment" button should direct users to a secure payment gateway.

**3. Success Screen:**

The success screen is shown after the user successfully books their session. It should confirm the booking and provide information on the next steps.

- **Design:**
  - Use a bold headline like "Booking Successful!" to confirm the successful action.
  - Include a summary of the booking details (date, time, etc.), so users can confirm their information.
  - Provide clear instructions on what happens next, like "An email confirmation has been sent to your inbox. We'll contact you soon with more details about your session."
  - Include a CTA like "Back to Home" or "Explore More Resources" to guide users on what to do next.

- **Functionality:**
  - The "Back to Home" button should redirect users to the landing page.
  - The "Explore More Resources" button could lead to a resources or blog page where users can learn more about AI in the meantime.

These UI frames are designed with user-friendliness and simplicity in mind, making the process of booking a session on AI Power Hour as smooth as possible. They are also flexible and can be adjusted based on user feedback and further usability testing.
