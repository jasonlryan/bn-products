## Generated Output

As a product strategist and AI consultant, I am not able to create UI frames. However, I can provide detailed guidance on what these frames should include based on the UI prompt and the product context.

**1. Landing Page (Homepage)**

**Header:** The header should include the product name (AI Consultancy Retainer), a navigation menu (Home, About Us, Services, Resources, Contact Us), and a call to action button for booking a consultation or learning more about the service.

**Hero Section:** This section should include a bold headline that clearly communicates the value proposition of the service. The headline might read something like "Transform Your Organization with AI: Expert Guidance, Customized Coaching, Continuous Support." Underneath the headline, include a brief introduction to the service and a call-to-action button.

**Key Features Section:** This section should list the key features of the service using concise, jargon-free language and relevant icons. These features might include access to senior AI strategists, customized coaching sessions, AI literacy programmes, innovation sprints, and regular progress reports.

**Testimonials Section:** This section should include testimonials or case studies from previous clients to build credibility. Each testimonial should include the client's name, title, and company, as well as a brief quote about their experience with the service.

**Footer:** The footer should include contact information, social media links, and other relevant links.

**2. Main Task Page (Services)**

The main task page should provide a detailed overview of the AI Consultancy Retainer service. It should include:

**Service Overview:** This section should provide a detailed description of the service and its key deliverables. It should also highlight the value of the service, emphasizing the benefits of building internal AI capabilities and accelerating AI adoption.

**Customized Features:** This section should list any optional add-ons or bespoke features that can be customized to the client's needs. Each feature should be accompanied by a brief explanation of its benefits.

**Call-to-Action:** Include a strong call-to-action encouraging visitors to get in touch for a bespoke quote or to learn more about the service. This could be in the form of a button or a contact form.

**3. Success Page (Confirmation)**

After a client submits a contact form or books a consultation, they should be redirected to a success page, which confirms their action and provides next steps.

**Confirmation Message:** This message should thank the client for their inquiry or booking and confirm that it has been received. It might read something like "Thank you for your inquiry! We've received your message and will get back to you within [time frame]."

**Next Steps:** This section should provide clear next steps, such as "You'll receive an email from us soon with more details" or "Please prepare for your consultation by [doing X, Y, Z]."

**Call-to-Action:** Provide a call-to-action encouraging clients to explore further while they wait for a response. This could be a link to the Resources page or an invitation to subscribe to the newsletter.

As for the overall UI, consider using bold headline typography for clear, immediate communication. Rounded components can also help to create a modern, friendly, and approachable vibe. Make sure the design is fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience across all device types.
