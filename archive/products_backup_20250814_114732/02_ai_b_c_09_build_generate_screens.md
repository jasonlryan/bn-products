## Generated Output

As an AI consultant and product strategist, I don't have the capability to design UI frames. However, I can provide a detailed overview of what these screens should entail.

**1. Landing Screen**

The landing screen should be engaging and informative, providing a snapshot of what AI-B-C™ is and what it offers.

- **Bold Headline Typography:** "Welcome to AI-B-C™ - Your Partner in AI Adoption & Expertise"
- **Subheading:** "Expert-led workshops & custom learning plans to fast-track your AI literacy"
- **Primary CTA:** "Get Started"
- **Rounded Components:** A rounded menu bar with options like "About", "Services", "Contact Us", etc.
- **Additional Elements:** A carousel featuring testimonials from satisfied clients and a section highlighting the key features of AI-B-C™.
  
**2. Main Task Screen**

The main task screen would primarily be the Custom Learning Plan Screen, where users interact with the product to create their learning path.

- **Bold Headline Typography:** "Your Custom Learning Plan"
- **Subheading:** "Tailored to your organization's AI maturity & learning needs"
- **Primary CTA:** "Begin Assessment"
- **Rounded Components:** Rounded cards for each module or section of the learning plan, which expand on click to provide more details.
- **Additional Elements:** An interactive, rounded form or questionnaire for the initial assessment. A progress bar showing the steps completed in creating the learning plan.
  
**3. Success Screen**

The success screen is when users have completed their learning journey and achieved their goal of AI literacy.

- **Bold Headline Typography:** "Congratulations on Completing Your AI Learning Journey!"
- **Subheading:** "You've made great strides in your AI literacy. Keep exploring, keep learning!"
- **Primary CTA:** "Explore Further Learning Resources"
- **Rounded Components:** A rounded, graphic representation (like a badge or certificate) of the learning completion.
- **Additional Elements:** A section showcasing their progress and achievements in a visual, interactive manner (like infographics or charts).

In terms of style, use a modern and professional font, such as Roboto or Arial, that is easy to read. The color scheme should reflect the brand identity of AI-B-C™, possibly incorporating blues and greys to symbolize trust and intelligence, coupled with brighter accent colors for CTAs and highlights. Use imagery and icons sparingly but strategically, to aid in navigation and comprehension. Lastly, ensure the UI is responsive to cater to users accessing the platform on different devices. 

Remember, these are just guidelines and the actual design would need to be done by a UI/UX designer.
