## Generated Output

**UI Prompt for AI Power Hour**

The UI for AI Power Hour should reflect the seriousness and sophistication of the product while remaining accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience. The design should embody a sense of modernity and innovation that aligns with the spirit of AI, but also use language that is clear and jargon-free. We should aim for a clean, minimalistic style with a clear focus on functionality and user experience.

1. **Home Screen/Landing Page:** This is the first screen users will see. It should clearly and succinctly communicate what AI Power Hour is, who it's for, and what it offers. This page should have a clear call to action, such as "Book Your Session Now" or "Get Started." 

2. **Booking Process:** This should be a simple, straightforward process. Users should be able to select a date and time for their session, provide details about their role and their specific AI-related task or challenge, and pay for their session. This process should be quick and painless, with clear instructions and prompts.

3. **Pre-Session Assessment:** This is where users provide more detailed information about their current level of AI literacy, specific needs, and areas of interest. This could be a simple form or survey, or it could be a more interactive process with prompts and questions to guide users.

4. **Session Screen:** This is where the actual coaching session will take place. It should be a simple, uncluttered interface with clear audio and video. There should be tools for sharing screens, making notes, and possibly even interactive whiteboards or similar features for collaborative problem-solving.

5. **Post-Session Resources:** After the session, users should be directed to a page where they can download their personalized follow-up materials. This should be a clean, easy-to-navigate interface with clear labels for different types of resources.

6. **Feedback/Review:** After the session, ask users for their feedback. This could be a simple form with a few questions about their experience, what they learned, and how they plan to apply their new knowledge. 

In terms of color scheme, consider using a combination of blues and whites. Blue is often associated with trust and reliability, while white gives a clean, modern feel. Use san-serif fonts for a modern, clean look. Ensure that the text size and contrast are enough for easy readability. 

Add visuals and graphics that align with the AI theme. For instance, a visual theme featuring abstract representations of neural networks could run throughout the website, subtly reinforcing the AI concept.

Remember, the focus should be on the user's journey – from understanding what AI Power Hour is, to booking a session, to participating in the session, to accessing follow-up materials. The design should make this journey as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
