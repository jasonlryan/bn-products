## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI-B-C™, we will use the top-down approach. This approach starts with the total market and then narrows it down to the segment that AI-B-C™ can serve.

**Step 1: Total Market Size**

To define the total market, we need to consider the total number of medium to large enterprises in the United Kingdom, as this is the primary target audience for AI-B-C™. According to the UK government's business population estimates for 2021, there are approximately 40,500 medium-sized businesses (with 50-249 employees) and 8,000 large businesses (with 250+ employees). If we add these, we get 48,500 businesses. 

**Step 2: Market Segmentation**

AI-B-C™ is specifically designed for organizations that are enthusiastic about AI but lack in-house expertise. According to a report by McKinsey, about 20% of businesses in the UK have started adopting AI in some form. So we can assume that these organizations are enthusiastic about AI. This gives us 20% of 48,500, which is 9,700 businesses.

**Step 3: Budget Considerations**

AI-B-C™ is not a cheap product, and only companies with a dedicated training budget can afford it. According to a report by Training Journal, approximately 85% of medium to large businesses in the UK have a dedicated training budget. Applying this percentage to the 9,700 businesses gives us 8,245 businesses.

**Step 4: Calculate Total Addressable Market (TAM)**

The TAM can be calculated by multiplying the number of potential customers (8,245 businesses) by the average revenue per user (ARPU). 

If we consider the mid-tier product option (one day AI Acceleration team day) priced at £8,800 as the most likely product choice for these businesses, the TAM would be:

8,245 businesses * £8,800 = £72,556,000

Therefore, the estimated Total Addressable Market for AI-B-C™ in the UK, based on these assumptions, is approximately £72.56 million.

It's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and actual market conditions can vary. Also, this estimation only considers the UK market. The TAM would be significantly larger if other markets were also considered.
