The service primarily requires commitment and active participation from the client's side. This includes:

1. Access to relevant stakeholders and team members for consultations, coaching, workshops, and strategy sessions.
2. Information sharing about the organisation's current capabilities, technology infrastructure, business goals, AI expectations, and readiness level for AI transformation.
3. Regular feedback, collaboration, and open communication channels to facilitate ongoing strategy refinement and progress reporting.

2. Customised Coaching/Advisory Sessions: Schedule sessions with key stakeholders to provide expert advice on AI strategy, adoption, and innovation.
3. AI Literacy Programmes and Upskilling Workshops: Deliver customised training and workshops to build AI skills across the organisation.
4. Innovation Frameworks and Pilot Delivery: Guide the organisation in applying AI to their business context through innovation sprints and pilot projects.

**Limitations:**
While the service aims to provide comprehensive support for AI adoption, there are certain limitations:

1. The success of the service heavily relies on the client's commitment, participation, and readiness to embrace change.
2. The service does not cover the actual development or full implementation of AI tools or systems. It primarily focuses on strategy, coaching, and supporting the client's team in adopting AI.
3. The measurable impact of AI on the business might not be immediately visible as it often requires time for full-scale implementation and adoption.
4. The service requires a long-term investment, and it might not be suitable for organisations looking for quick, short-term fixes.
5. The service does not guarantee specific business outcomes as they can be influenced by various factors beyond the scope of the service, such as market conditions, business model, or organisational culture.
