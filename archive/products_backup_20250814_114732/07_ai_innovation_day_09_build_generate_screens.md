## Generated Output

Unfortunately, as an AI text-based model, I am unable to create visual content or UI frames. However, I can certainly help guide you on what should be included in the UI frames for the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens based on the provided UI prompt.

**1. Landing Screen:**

The Landing Screen should be warm and welcoming, exuding a sense of excitement for what's to come. Here are some components you should consider:

- Bold headline typography stating "Welcome to AI Innovation Day"
- A subheadline or brief description of the workshop that aligns with the product's core values of speed, efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.
- A "Get Started" or "Begin Workshop" button that leads to the Main Task screen.
- Branding elements such as the AI Innovation Day logo and brand colors.
- Ensure that all elements have rounded corners to align with the rounded components instruction.

**2. Main Task Screen:**

This is the core of the product, where users will spend most of their time. Here's what you should include:

- A clear, bold headline indicating the current phase of the workshop (e.g., "Ideation Phase").
- A shared workspace area with a minimalistic look. Include rounded, drag-and-drop elements such as text boxes, images, and shapes.
- An easily accessible AI Assistant via a floating button or slide-out panel. Use a friendly, conversational interface for this feature.
- A visible timeline or progress bar that shows the phases of the workshop and the current position.
- A "Next" or "Submit" button to proceed to the Success screen when the task is complete.

**3. Success Screen:**

The Success Screen is where users celebrate their accomplishments and reflect on their experiences. Here's what you could include:

- A bold, congratulatory headline such as "Congratulations, you did it!".
- A summary or overview of what they've accomplished, perhaps with a preview of their prototype.
- An actionable next step, such as a "Download Prototype" or "Share Your Work" button.
- Feedback form with ratings sliders for different aspects of the workshop (e.g., usefulness of AI Assistant, overall experience) and open text boxes for general comments and suggestions.
- A "Continue" or "Exit Workshop" button to wrap up the session.

Remember, the aim is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and intuitive interface that enhances the experience of the AI Innovation Day participants. Make sure to test your designs with users to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.
