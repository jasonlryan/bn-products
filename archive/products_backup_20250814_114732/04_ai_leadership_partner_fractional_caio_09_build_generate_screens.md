2. **Navigation Bar:** Include links to 'About Us', 'Services', 'Success Stories', and 'Contact Us'. Use a clear, easy-to-read font and ensure these links are prominent.

3. **Main Section:** Include a compelling headline about the service (e.g., "Empower Your Business with Strategic AI Leadership"). Below the headline, include a brief description of the service and its benefits. Use bullet points or icons to highlight key features (e.g., Strategy Sessions, Advisory Services, Talent Acquisition Support).

4. **Call to Action (CTA):** Include a CTA button with text like "Schedule a Consultation" or "Get Started". Make the button large and in a contrasting color to draw attention.

**Main Task Screen (Client Dashboard):**

1. **Header:** Include the website name and tagline on the left, with a welcome message and user's name on the right.

2. **Navigation Bar:** Include links to 'Dashboard', 'My Strategy', 'Sessions', 'Assessments', and 'Support'. 

3. **Main Section:** Divide this section into a few parts. On the left, include a list of upcoming sessions and a button to schedule a new one. In the middle, display a visual representation of the client's AI maturity progress. On the right, provide a summary of the latest AI capability assessment results.

4. **CTA:** Include a CTA to return to the dashboard or perform another task (e.g., "Back to Dashboard" or "Schedule Another Session").

**Style Guidelines:**

1. **Color Scheme:** Use a professional color scheme with shades of blue for trust and reliability, combined with clean whites and greys for a sleek, modern look.

2. **Typography:** Use a modern sans-serif font that is easy to read. For headlines, use bold typography to draw attention.

3. **Imagery:** Use high-quality, professional images that reflect the innovative and transformative nature of AI. Images should be consistent in style and tone.

4. **Icons:** Use simple, clear icons to represent different services and features. Ensure consistency in style and size across all icons.
