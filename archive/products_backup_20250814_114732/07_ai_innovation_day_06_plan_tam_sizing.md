## Generated Output

**Product: AI Innovation Day**

In order to estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our product, we need to identify the potential customers who would be interested in our offering, and the average revenue we could generate from each of these customers.

Let’s break down the TAM calculation into two main components:

1.	**Customer Segments:** Based on the product context and previous outputs, our ideal clients are medium to large organisations actively investing in innovation, teams with a strategic mandate to explore AI capability, brands with internal pressure to launch and learn faster, and leaders who want to prove value through doing, not decks. These could be found across various industries including Technology, Retail, Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, etc.

2.	**Average Revenue per Customer:** Our AI Innovation Day is priced at £8,800 per workshop.

To estimate the TAM, we need to multiply the total number of potential customers by the average revenue per customer, i.e., TAM = Number of Customers * Average Revenue per Customer.

Here are some assumptions that we need to make for our TAM calculation:

1.	**Market Penetration:** Let’s assume that we can reach 5% of the medium to large organisations in the UK that are actively investing in innovation and exploring AI capabilities. 
2.	**Customer Composition:** Assume that 10% of these organisations are ‘ideal clients’ as described in the product context. This could be a conservative estimate given the increased interest in AI and rapid innovation in recent years.
3.	**Frequency of Purchase:** Assume that each customer would buy the AI Innovation Day workshop once a year. This is a reasonable assumption as organisations may want to conduct such workshops periodically to keep up with the fast pace of innovation.

Now, let’s quantify these assumptions:

1.	Number of medium to large organisations in the UK: According to the UK Government's Business Population Estimates, there were approximately 8,000 large businesses and 37,485 medium-sized businesses in the UK in 2021. Let's round this off to 45,000 medium to large organisations.
2.	Number of potential customers (5% of the total number of medium to large organisations): 45,000 * 5% = 2,250
3.	Number of 'ideal clients' (10% of the potential customers): 2,250 * 10% = 225
4.	Total Addressable Market (TAM): 225 customers * £8,800 = £1,980,000

Therefore, the Total Addressable Market for our AI Innovation Day, based on these assumptions, is approximately £1.98 million in the UK.

Please note that the TAM could be larger if we expand our market to other countries or if we can penetrate a larger share of the market. However, this estimate provides a starting point for understanding the potential market size for our product.
