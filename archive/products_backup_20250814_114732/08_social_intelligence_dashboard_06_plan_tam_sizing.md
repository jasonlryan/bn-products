## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the Social Intelligence Dashboard within the automotive and motorcycle industries, we can use the top-down approach. This method starts with large, macro-level data and progressively narrows it down to the specific market we're interested in. 

Here's how we can approach it:

**Step 1: Overall Market Size**
Firstly, we need to estimate the overall market size for the automotive and motorcycle industries combined. According to Statista, the global automotive market was worth approximately $2.7 trillion in 2020, and the global motorcycle market was worth around $120 billion in the same year. Combining these, the total global market size for both industries is about $2.82 trillion.

**Step 2: Percentage of Firms with €50M+ Revenue**
Our target customers are mid to large-sized companies in these industries with €50M+ annual revenue. Unfortunately, exact percentage data for this subset of companies is not readily available. However, we can make an educated assumption. According to data from the European Commission, approximately 1% of companies in the EU can be classified as 'large' (i.e., earning €50M+ in revenue). As a conservative estimate, we'll assume this percentage is applicable globally.

**Step 3: Average Spend on Market Research**
Next, we need to estimate what percentage of their revenue these companies typically spend on market research. According to a report by Forrester, companies typically allocate around 10% of their revenue on marketing, and around 10% of that marketing budget is spent on market research. So, approximately 1% of a company's revenue might be allocated to market research.

**Step 4: Calculate TAM**
Finally, we calculate the TAM by applying these percentages to the overall market size.

Here's the equation:

$2.82 trillion (overall market size) X 1% (percentage of firms with €50M+ revenue) X 1% (percentage of revenue spent on market research) = TAM

**Please note:** All these figures are rough estimates and the actual TAM might be different due to various factors. Furthermore, the TAM for the Social Intelligence Dashboard could be even larger if we consider secondary markets such as marketing agencies serving automotive/motorcycle clients, or if we expand the product to serve additional industries in the future.
