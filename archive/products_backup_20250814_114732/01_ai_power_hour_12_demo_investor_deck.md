**Slide 1: Vision**
"To empower leaders across industries by bridging the AI knowledge gap, enabling them to leverage AI's transformative power for strategic advantage, enhanced customer experience, and innovation."

**Slide 2: Problem**
Despite AI's ubiquity in today's business landscape, a significant knowledge gap exists among senior leaders and functional heads. This gap hinders their ability to leverage AI effectively for strategic objectives, customer experience enhancement, and innovation. They often struggle with understanding AI's practical applications, which stifle progress and limit their organizations' competitive edge.

**Slide 3: Solution**
Our solution is AI Power Hour, a personalized one-hour coaching session that provides a deep dive into a specific AI-related task or challenge. It comes with tailored follow-up materials for continuous learning and lasting impact. The AI Power Hour is designed to boost AI literacy, equip leaders with practical problem-solving skills, and provide immediate strategic value.

**Slide 4: Market Opportunity**
There are approximately 135,000 potential customers in the UK market alone, amounting to a total addressable market of £40.5 million. This includes high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads across various industries. As AI continues to permeate all sectors, the demand for understanding and leveraging AI is expected to grow, presenting a significant market opportunity.

**Slide 5: Positioning**
AI Power Hour stands out in the competitive landscape for its personalized and practical approach. Unlike generic AI courses, AI Power Hour offers one-on-one coaching sessions tailored to the individual’s needs and role, providing real-world solutions, and building one's AI literacy for immediate strategic application.

**Slide 6: Business Model**
AI Power Hour is priced at £300 per session, which includes the one-hour coaching and follow-up materials. Our revenue will primarily come from these sessions. In the future, we plan to offer additional services like post-session support, advanced level sessions, and group sessions for teams.

**Slide 7: Competitive Landscape**
Our competitors include AI Academy by DataRobot, AI For Everyone by Coursera, AI Business School by Microsoft, AI Foundations for Everyone by IBM, and Deep Learning Specialization by Coursera. While these competitors offer a broad range of AI topics, they lack the personalized guidance and focus on practical problem-solving that AI Power Hour provides.

**Slide 8: Ask**
We are seeking £1 million in funding to expand our product offerings, invest in marketing to reach more potential customers, and build a robust technology infrastructure to support our services. This investment will help us capture a larger share of the growing AI education market.

AI Power Hour is more than just a coaching session - it's a catalyst for change and a tool for empowerment. With your investment, we can help more leaders harness the power of AI, driving transformation, innovation, and growth in their organizations.
