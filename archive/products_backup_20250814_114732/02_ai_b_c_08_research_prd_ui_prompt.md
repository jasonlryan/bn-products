## Generated Output

**UI Prompts for Design Tool**

The UI of the AI-B-C™ should embody a professional, clean, and modern aesthetic, reflecting the transformative and forward-thinking nature of AI technology itself. It should be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to the various roles within an organization, from executive leadership to IT managers. Given the diverse audience, the UI should be accessible and inclusive, using clear language and visual cues to guide users through the platform.

**1. Welcome Screen**

This is the first screen users will encounter. It should feature a clear and concise overview of AI-B-C™, its mission, and its offerings. A clear call-to-action (CTA) to "Get Started" should be prominently displayed. The design should be clean, with a modern color palette that reflects AI-B-C™'s brand identity. The use of imagery related to AI, such as neural networks or data visualizations, could also help set the tone.

**2. Assessment Screen**

This screen will be used to gather information about the organization's current AI maturity level and specific learning needs. It should include a simple, intuitive form or questionnaire. The design should guide the user through each question, using visual cues to indicate progress and next steps. The language should be clear, avoiding jargon, and ensuring all users, regardless of their current AI knowledge, can understand and complete the assessment.

**3. Custom Learning Plan Screen**

This screen will showcase the custom learning plan tailored to the organization's needs. It should clearly present the different modules or sections of the learning plan, and provide a brief overview of each. Interactive elements, such as expandable sections for more detail, could be used to keep the screen uncluttered. The overall design should inspire excitement and anticipation for the learning journey ahead.

**4. Workshop/Webinar Screen**

This screen will host the expert-led workshops and webinars. It should include video and chat functionalities for interactive sessions. A clear structure, showing the agenda or key points for each session, should be included. The design should promote engagement and interaction, with clear CTAs for asking questions or providing feedback.

**5. Progress Assessment Screen**

This screen will provide users with an overview of their progress throughout the learning program. Visual representations, such as progress bars or charts, could be used to display progress in a clear, easy-to-understand manner. The design should be encouraging, highlighting achievements and areas of improvement.

**6. Resource Screen**

This screen will provide access to additional learning resources, such as articles, guides, and case studies. The design should be clean and organized, allowing users to easily navigate and find resources relevant to their interests or needs.

In terms of style, use a modern and professional font, such as Roboto or Arial, that is easy to read. The color scheme should reflect the brand identity of AI-B-C™, possibly incorporating blues and greys to symbolize trust and intelligence, coupled with brighter accent colors for CTAs and highlights. Use imagery and icons sparingly but strategically, to aid in navigation and comprehension. Lastly, ensure the UI is responsive to cater to users accessing the platform on different devices.
