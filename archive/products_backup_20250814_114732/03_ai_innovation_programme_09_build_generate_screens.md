## Generated Output

Creating UI frames for the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens is a critical part of the design process. Here's how you can approach this task:

**1. Landing Screen:**

* **Bold Headline Typography:** Start with a bold, attention-grabbing headline that communicates the main value proposition of the AI Innovation Programme. The headline could be something like "Unleash the Power of AI in Your Business with Our AI Innovation Programme". 

* **Visual Elements:** Use high-quality, relevant images or graphics to quickly communicate the tech-focused nature of the service. You might include images of a diverse group of people working together, or abstract imagery that represents AI and innovation.

* **Rounded Components:** Incorporate rounded components to give the design a modern, friendly feel. This could include rounded buttons, form fields, or image borders.

* **Clear CTA:** Include a clear, compelling call-to-action (CTA) that guides users to the next step. This could be a button that says "Learn More" or "Get Started".

**2. Main Task Screen (Services/Package Details):**

* **Bold Headline Typography:** Use bold headings to clearly delineate each service included in the AI Innovation Programme.

* **Tabbed Sections:** Use tabbed sections or accordion-style dropdowns to organize information about each service. This keeps the page clean and allows users to easily navigate to the information they need.

* **Rounded Components:** Continue to use rounded components for a consistent look and feel.

* **Interactive Elements:** Consider including an interactive feature, such as a slider or dropdown menu, that allows users to see more details about each service.

* **CTA:** Include a CTA that encourages users to take the next step, such as contacting you for more information or starting the sign-up process.

**3. Success Screen (Case Studies/Success Stories):**

* **Bold Headline Typography:** Start with a bold headline that highlights the success of the AI Innovation Programme, like "See How Our Clients Have Transformed Their Businesses with AI".

* **Case Study Sections:** Include sections for each case study or success story. Each section should include an engaging headline, a brief description of the company and their challenge, and an overview of the results achieved through the AI Innovation Programme.

* **Rounded Components:** Use rounded components, such as rounded image borders, to give the design a modern and cohesive look.

* **Interactive Elements:** Consider incorporating interactive elements, such as a carousel that allows users to scroll through different case studies.

* **CTA:** End with a strong CTA that encourages users to start their own success story with the AI Innovation Programme.

Remember to keep the design responsive for mobile devices and accessible for all users. Test the design on different screen sizes to ensure it looks good and works well on all devices, and follow accessibility best practices to ensure all users can easily navigate the site.
