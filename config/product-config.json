We'll also assume that we're targeting companies with more than 50 employees, as they are more likely to have the roles (high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads) that would benefit from AI Power Hour.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how we could calculate the TAM:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Target Companies in the UK:** According to the Office for National Statistics, there were about 27,000 businesses with 50 or more employees in the UK in 2020 (excluding the public sector). \n\n2. **Estimate the Number of Potential Customers per Company:** Let's assume each of these companies has five employees (CEO, CIO, CMO, Head of Customer Experience, and a Team Lead) who would be interested in AI Power Hour. This is a conservative estimate given larger companies will likely have multiple functional heads and team leads who could benefit from the product.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Potential Customers:** Multiply the number of target companies by the estimated number of potential customers per company. \n\n   Total Potential Customers = Number of Target Companies * Potential Customers per Company \n   = 27,000 companies * 5 potential customers per company \n   = 135,000 potential customers\n\n4. **Estimate the Revenue per Customer:** This is the price of AI Power Hour, which is £300.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Multiply the total number of potential customers by the revenue per customer.\n\n   TAM = Total Potential Customers * Revenue per Customer \n   = 135,000 potential customers * £300 per customer \n   = £40,500,000\n\nSo, based on these assumptions, the TAM for AI Power Hour in the UK market is approximately £40.5 million. \n\nPlease note that this is a simplified approach to estimating the TAM. It's based on a number of assumptions and doesn't take into account factors like market penetration rate, growth rate, or competitive landscape. Further research and a more detailed analysis may be required for a more accurate estimate."

              "raw_content": "**UI Prompt for AI Power Hour**\n\nThe UI for AI Power Hour should reflect the seriousness and sophistication of the product while remaining accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience. The design should embody a sense of modernity and innovation that aligns with the spirit of AI, but also use language that is clear and jargon-free. We should aim for a clean, minimalistic style with a clear focus on functionality and user experience.\n\n1. **Home Screen/Landing Page:** This is the first screen users will see. It should clearly and succinctly communicate what AI Power Hour is, who it's for, and what it offers. This page should have a clear call to action, such as \"Book Your Session Now\" or \"Get Started.\" \n\n2. **Booking Process:** This should be a simple, straightforward process. Users should be able to select a date and time for their session, provide details about their role and their specific AI-related task or challenge, and pay for their session. This process should be quick and painless, with clear instructions and prompts.\n\n3. **Pre-Session Assessment:** This is where users provide more detailed information about their current level of AI literacy, specific needs, and areas of interest. This could be a simple form or survey, or it could be a more interactive process with prompts and questions to guide users.\n\n4. **Session Screen:** This is where the actual coaching session will take place. It should be a simple, uncluttered interface with clear audio and video. There should be tools for sharing screens, making notes, and possibly even interactive whiteboards or similar features for collaborative problem-solving.\n\n5. **Post-Session Resources:** After the session, users should be directed to a page where they can download their personalized follow-up materials. This should be a clean, easy-to-navigate interface with clear labels for different types of resources.\n\n6. **Feedback/Review:** After the session, ask users for their feedback. This could be a simple form with a few questions about their experience, what they learned, and how they plan to apply their new knowledge. \n\nIn terms of color scheme, consider using a combination of blues and whites. Blue is often associated with trust and reliability, while white gives a clean, modern feel. Use san-serif fonts for a modern, clean look. Ensure that the text size and contrast are enough for easy readability. \n\nAdd visuals and graphics that align with the AI theme. For instance, a visual theme featuring abstract representations of neural networks could run throughout the website, subtly reinforcing the AI concept.\n\nRemember, the focus should be on the user's journey – from understanding what AI Power Hour is, to booking a session, to participating in the session, to accessing follow-up materials. The design should make this journey as smooth and enjoyable as possible."

Landing Screen:**\n\nThe landing screen will be the first point of interaction with the users. It should be designed to provide a clear understanding of AI Power Hour, its benefits, and its target audience.\n\n- **Design:**\n  - Use a bold headline typography like \"Unleash AI's Potential With Personalized Learning\" to immediately grab attention.\n  - Follow with a concise explanation of the product and its benefits.\n  - Include visuals or icons emphasizing key features - personalized guidance, real-world solutions, improved AI literacy.\n  - Use a color scheme of blues and whites for a clean, professional look.\n  - Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) button like \"Book Your Session Now\" in a contrasting color to make it stand out.\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - The CTA button should direct users to the booking process page.\n  - A menu or navigation bar should be present for users to explore more about the product, FAQ, contact information, etc.\n\n**2. Main Task Screen:**\n\nThe main task screen is where users will book their session and provide information about their role and AI-related needs. The design should be intuitive and designed for easy information input.\n\n- **Design:**\n  - Use form fields or dropdown menus for users to input their information.\n  - Include fields for date and time selection for the session.\n  - Add a section for users to describe their specific AI-related task or challenge.\n  - Include a \"Proceed to Payment\" button after all necessary information is filled.\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - The date and time field should provide a calendar view for easy selection.\n  - The specific task/challenge field can have prompt text to guide users in providing required information.\n  - The \"Proceed to Payment\" button should direct users to a secure payment gateway.\n\n**3. Success Screen:**\n\nThe success screen is shown after the user successfully books their session. It should confirm the booking and provide information on the next steps.\n\n- **Design:**\n  - Use a bold headline like \"Booking Successful!\" to confirm the successful action.\n  - Include a summary of the booking details (date, time, etc.), so users can confirm their information.\n  - Provide clear instructions on what happens next, like \"An email confirmation has been sent to your inbox. We'll contact you soon with more details about your session.\"\n  - Include a CTA like \"Back to Home\" or \"Explore More Resources\" to guide users on what to do next.\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - The \"Back to Home\" button should redirect users to the landing page.\n  - The \"Explore More Resources\" button could lead to a resources or blog page where users can learn more about AI in the meantime.\n\nThese UI frames are designed with user-friendliness and simplicity in mind, making the process of booking a session on AI Power Hour as smooth as possible. They are also flexible and can be adjusted based on user feedback and further usability testing."

This gap hinders their ability to leverage AI effectively for strategic objectives, customer experience enhancement, and innovation. They often struggle with understanding AI's practical applications, which stifle progress and limit their organizations' competitive edge.\n\n**Slide 3: Solution**\nOur solution is AI Power Hour, a personalized one-hour coaching session that provides a deep dive into a specific AI-related task or challenge. It comes with tailored follow-up materials for continuous learning and lasting impact. The AI Power Hour is designed to boost AI literacy, equip leaders with practical problem-solving skills, and provide immediate strategic value.\n\n**Slide 4: Market Opportunity**\nThere are approximately 135,000 potential customers in the UK market alone, amounting to a total addressable market of £40.5 million. This includes high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads across various industries. As AI continues to permeate all sectors, the demand for understanding and leveraging AI is expected to grow, presenting a significant market opportunity.\n\n**Slide 5: Positioning**\nAI Power Hour stands out in the competitive landscape for its personalized and practical approach. Unlike generic AI courses, AI Power Hour offers one-on-one coaching sessions tailored to the individual’s needs and role, providing real-world solutions, and building one's AI literacy for immediate strategic application.\n\n**Slide 6: Business Model**\nAI Power Hour is priced at £300 per session, which includes the one-hour coaching and follow-up materials. Our revenue will primarily come from these sessions. In the future, we plan to offer additional services like post-session support, advanced level sessions, and group sessions for teams.\n\n**Slide 7: Competitive Landscape**\nOur competitors include AI Academy by DataRobot, AI For Everyone by Coursera, AI Business School by Microsoft, AI Foundations for Everyone by IBM, and Deep Learning Specialization by Coursera. While these competitors offer a broad range of AI topics, they lack the personalized guidance and focus on practical problem-solving that AI Power Hour provides.\n\n**Slide 8: Ask**\nWe are seeking £1 million in funding to expand our product offerings, invest in marketing to reach more potential customers, and build a robust technology infrastructure to support our services. This investment will help us capture a larger share of the growing AI education market.\n\n**Slide 9: Closing Statement**\nAI Power Hour is more than just a coaching session - it's a catalyst for change and a tool for empowerment. With your investment, we can help more leaders harness the power of AI, driving transformation, innovation, and growth in their organizations. Together, we can shape a future where AI is leveraged to its fullest potential.\n\nNote: The actual investor deck would be a visual representation of this information, using engaging graphics, charts, and diagrams to illustrate key points."

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI-B-C™, we will use the top-down approach. This approach starts with the total market and then narrows it down to the segment that AI-B-C™ can serve.\n\n**Step 1: Total Market Size**\n\nTo define the total market, we need to consider the total number of medium to large enterprises in the United Kingdom, as this is the primary target audience for AI-B-C™. According to the UK government's business population estimates for 2021, there are approximately 40,500 medium-sized businesses (with 50-249 employees) and 8,000 large businesses (with 250+ employees). If we add these, we get 48,500 businesses. \n\n**Step 2: Market Segmentation**\n\nAI-B-C™ is specifically designed for organizations that are enthusiastic about AI but lack in-house expertise. According to a report by McKinsey, about 20% of businesses in the UK have started adopting AI in some form. So we can assume that these organizations are enthusiastic about AI. This gives us 20% of 48,500, which is 9,700 businesses.\n\n**Step 3: Budget Considerations**\n\nAI-B-C™ is not a cheap product, and only companies with a dedicated training budget can afford it. According to a report by Training Journal, approximately 85% of medium to large businesses in the UK have a dedicated training budget. Applying this percentage to the 9,700 businesses gives us 8,245 businesses.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Total Addressable Market (TAM)**\n\nThe TAM can be calculated by multiplying the number of potential customers (8,245 businesses) by the average revenue per user (ARPU). \n\nIf we consider the mid-tier product option (one day AI Acceleration team day) priced at £8,800 as the most likely product choice for these businesses, the TAM would be:\n\n8,245 businesses * £8,800 = £72,556,000\n\nTherefore, the estimated Total Addressable Market for AI-B-C™ in the UK, based on these assumptions, is approximately £72.56 million.\n\nIt's important to note that this estimation is based on several assumptions and actual market conditions can vary. Also, this estimation only considers the UK market. The TAM would be significantly larger if other markets were also considered."

Main Task Screen**\n\nThe main task screen would primarily be the Custom Learning Plan Screen, where users interact with the product to create their learning path.\n\n- **Bold Headline Typography:** \"Your Custom Learning Plan\"\n- **Subheading:** \"Tailored to your organization's AI maturity & learning needs\"\n- **Primary CTA:** \"Begin Assessment\"\n- **Rounded Components:** Rounded cards for each module or section of the learning plan, which expand on click to provide more details.\n- **Additional Elements:** An interactive, rounded form or questionnaire for the initial assessment. A progress bar showing the steps completed in creating the learning plan.\n  \n**3. Success Screen**\n\nThe success screen is when users have completed their learning journey and achieved their goal of AI literacy.\n\n- **Bold Headline Typography:** \"Congratulations on Completing Your AI Learning Journey!\"\n- **Subheading:** \"You've made great strides in your AI literacy. Keep exploring, keep learning!\"\n- **Primary CTA:** \"Explore Further Learning Resources\"\n- **Rounded Components:** A rounded, graphic representation (like a badge or certificate) of the learning completion.\n- **Additional Elements:** A section showcasing their progress and achievements in a visual, interactive manner (like infographics or charts).\n\nIn terms of style, use a modern and professional font, such as Roboto or Arial, that is easy to read. The color scheme should reflect the brand identity of AI-B-C™, possibly incorporating blues and greys to symbolize trust and intelligence, coupled with brighter accent colors for CTAs and highlights. Use imagery and icons sparingly but strategically, to aid in navigation and comprehension. Lastly, ensure the UI is responsive to cater to users accessing the platform on different devices. \n\nRemember, these are just guidelines and the actual design would need to be done by a UI/UX designer."

Smaller or medium-sized businesses may not be able to afford or fully utilise their services.\n\n**Gap we exploit:** Our AI Innovation Programme is designed for medium to large companies, making it more accessible to businesses that are at a medium level of AI maturity. We also provide metrics and evaluation frameworks for AI initiatives, which can help clients to measure their progress and success.\n\n**Competing Product 4: Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Gamma**\n\n**Value Prop:** BCG Gamma is an AI and data science consulting service that helps businesses develop and implement AI solutions.\n\n**Pricing:** Project-based pricing.\n\n**Strength:** BCG Gamma has a strong reputation in the consulting industry and has a team of experienced data scientists and AI professionals.\n\n**Weakness:** BCG Gamma may be more focused on data science initiatives, and their services may be too technical and advanced for companies that are still at a medium level of AI maturity.\n\n**Gap we exploit:** Our AI Innovation Programme is designed to simplify AI challenges and provide advice, making it ideal for companies that are still learning about AI. We also provide a more comprehensive service, from ideation to integration and evaluation."

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our AI Innovation Programme, we need to first identify the number of potential customers (companies) that fit into our ideal customer profile and then multiply it by the average annual revenue we expect to generate from each customer.\n\nLet's break down the TAM calculation:\n\n1. **Potential Customer Base:** Our ideal customer profile includes medium to large companies with dedicated R&D budgets, who are innovation-focused and willing to experiment with AI. These companies are likely in tech, PR, agency landscape, finance, or other AI-amenable industries. \n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 200,000 businesses in the US with more than 100 employees. Assuming that 20% of these businesses are in our target industries and have a dedicated R&D budget, we get a potential customer base of 40,000 companies.\n\n2. **Average Revenue Per Customer:** The pricing for our AI Innovation Programme is bespoke, but let's assume that the average annual revenue we expect to generate from each customer is $100,000. This figure takes into account the cost of workshops, consultancy, and prototype build package, and is an estimate based on industry standards and our value proposition.\n\nUsing these assumptions, we can now calculate the TAM:\n\nTAM = Potential Customer Base x Average Revenue Per Customer\nTAM = 40,000 companies x $100,000\nTAM = $4 billion\n\nTherefore, the estimated Total Addressable Market for our AI Innovation Programme is $4 billion. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate. The actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on factors like the actual percentage of businesses in our target industries that have a dedicated R&D budget, the average revenue we can generate from each customer, and market changes that could affect the number of potential customers or the average revenue per customer."

Use clean lines and plenty of white space to give the design a minimalist, uncluttered feel. The typography should be clear and easy to read, with bold headings to break up the text and guide the user through the content.\n\n**Key Screens:**\n\n1. **Homepage:** This is the first screen users will see, so it should make a strong impression. The homepage should provide a brief overview of the AI Innovation Programme, highlighting its key features and benefits. Use eye-catching graphics or images to draw the user in, and include a clear call-to-action (CTA) to encourage users to learn more or get started.\n\n2. **About Us/Programme Overview:** This screen should provide more detailed information about the AI Innovation Programme, including its purpose, process, and what clients can expect. Break up the text with bullet points, infographics, or short explainer videos to make the content more digestible.\n\n3. **Services/Package Details:** This screen should outline the specific services included in the AI Innovation Programme, such as the consulting, workshops, prototyping, and testing support.

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service, we can use the top-down market sizing approach. This involves identifying a larger market that we are part of, and then narrowing it down based on the proportion of the market that our service caters to.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Larger Market**\n\nOur service is part of the larger AI consulting market. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI consulting market size was valued at USD 6.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% from 2021 to 2028. \n\n**Step 2: Narrow Down Based on Geographical Reach**\n\nLet's assume our service is initially targeting clients in the United States. According to the same report, North America accounted for the largest share of the AI consulting market, with 40% of the total market in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the size of the AI consulting market in the United States in 2020 was approximately $2.56 billion (40% of $6.4 billion).\n\n**Step 3: Narrow Down Based on Client Size**\n\nOur ideal client is a large enterprise or a fast-growing scale-up. According to data from the US Small Business Administration, large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups account for about 50% of the total number of businesses in the US.\n\nTherefore, the size of our TAM in terms of client size is approximately $1.28 billion (50% of $2.56 billion).\n\n**Step 4: Narrow Down Based on AI Maturity**\n\nOur service is ideally suited to organizations with a low to medium AI maturity level. Based on a report by McKinsey, approximately 70% of businesses are still in the early stages of AI maturity.\n\nTherefore, the size of our TAM in terms of AI maturity is approximately $0.896 billion (70% of $1.28 billion).\n\n**Step 5: Narrow Down Based on Attitude Towards AI**\n\nOur service targets organizations that view AI as a strategic imperative. According to a survey by Gartner, around 60% of organizations view AI as a strategic imperative.\n\nTherefore, the final TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service is approximately $0.538 billion (60% of $0.896 billion).\n\n**Summary:**\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service in the United States is approximately $538 million.\n\nThis is a rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors. For a more precise estimate, we would need more specific data on the number of large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups in the US that view AI as a strategic imperative and are in the early stages of AI maturity."

We aim to guide organizations in leveraging AI's potential, helping them lead innovation in their industry, and ultimately shape the future.\n\n**2. Problem:**\nIn the rapidly evolving world of technology, AI stands at the forefront of innovation and disruption. Many large enterprises and fast-rising scale-ups recognize AI's potential for growth and differentiation but lack the internal expertise and strategic direction to integrate it effectively. They risk falling behind, losing their competitive edge, or even facing disruption.\n\n**3. Solution:**\nOur AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service is the bridge to this gap. We offer regular strategy sessions with AI experts, ongoing advisory services at the executive/board level, support in AI-related decision making, assistance with AI talent acquisition and development, and regular AI capability assessments and roadmap updates. We guide organizations from a state of low to medium AI maturity to a competitive advantage, cutting their learning time and leading the AI revolution in their industry.\n\n**4. Market Opportunity:**\nThe global AI consulting market was valued at USD 6.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 33.5% from 2021 to 2028. Our service targets large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups in the United States that view AI as a strategic imperative and are in the early stages of AI maturity. This gives us a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of approximately $538 million in the United States alone.\n\n**5. Positioning:**\nWe position ourselves as a long-term strategic partner for organizations viewing AI as a strategic imperative. Our service stands out by offering a more personalized and hands-on approach, providing ongoing strategy development, regular strategy reviews, and a sharp focus on AI and its strategic implementation.\n\n**6.

Revenue streams include fees for regular strategy sessions, ongoing advisory services, AI talent acquisition and development support, and AI capability assessments and roadmap updates.\n\n**7. Competitive Landscape:**\nOur main competitors include AI consulting services from Deloitte, Accenture, and Andrew Ng’s Landing AI. However, our unique value proposition of offering a more personalized service, continuous support, and specific focus on AI strategy for organizations with low to medium AI maturity allows us to exploit gaps in the market.\n\n**8. Ask:**\nWe are seeking $XX million in funding to scale our operations, invest in marketing to reach more potential clients, and continue enhancing our service offerings. This funding will help us capture a greater share of the $538 million TAM.\n\n**9.

Unlike many providers, we focus specifically on executive-level guidance and capability development, ensuring that clients are not only aware of AI opportunities but are actively equipped to implement them. Our fractional CAIO model allows organizations to access high-level expertise without the commitment of a full-time hire, eliminating delays and risks.\n\n2. **Question:** How do you measure the effectiveness of your consultancy services?\n\n   **Answer:** We utilize a combination of KPIs and qualitative assessments to evaluate impact.

We also conduct regular strategy reviews and capability assessments to ensure alignment with business objectives and adapt our approach as needed.\n\n3. **Question:** Can you detail your approach to AI talent acquisition and development?\n\n   **Answer:** Our approach is multifaceted: We first conduct a skills assessment to identify gaps in the existing team’s capabilities. Based on this analysis, we develop tailored training programs that can include workshops, mentorship, and access to online resources.

This ensures that our team remains at the forefront of AI advancements. Additionally, we incorporate client feedback and industry case studies into our strategy development process, allowing us to adapt our methodologies to the latest trends and technologies.\n\n6. **Question:** What are the risks associated with engaging in AI initiatives, and how do you mitigate them?\n\n   **Answer:** Key risks include misalignment of AI strategies with business goals, underestimating resource requirements, and potential ethical concerns. We mitigate these risks by conducting thorough initial assessments to align our strategies with client objectives, providing clear project roadmaps, and ensuring ethical AI practices through governance frameworks. Regular strategy reviews allow us to adjust initiatives based on performance and external changes, ensuring ongoing alignment and risk management.\n\n7. **Question:** What is your customer acquisition strategy for this service?\n\n   **Answer:** Our customer acquisition strategy focuses on targeted outreach to decision-makers in large enterprises and high-growth scale-ups that recognize the importance of AI. We will leverage thought leadership content, case studies, and success stories to demonstrate our expertise and value proposition. Networking at industry conferences, partnerships with technology organizations, and direct outreach via industry-specific channels will also play critical roles in attracting clients.\n\n8. **Question:** How do you plan to address the potential backlash or skepticism toward AI from employees or stakeholders?\n\n   **Answer:** We believe that transparency and education are key. We will facilitate open discussions and workshops that address concerns, demystify AI technologies, and highlight their potential benefits. By involving employees in the AI strategy development process and providing training, we can foster a culture of collaboration and innovation, turning skepticism into enthusiasm. Regular communication about successes and learnings will also help build trust and facilitate buy-in from all stakeholders.\n\nThese responses highlight the strategic considerations and actionable plans behind the AI Leadership Partner service, demonstrating its value proposition and addressing potential investor concerns comprehensively."

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product, we first need to define the market we're addressing. Given the product's broad applicability across various industries and business sizes, and its global reach, we can define our market as the global market for market research services.\n\nAccording to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global market for market research services was estimated to be $73.4 billion in 2021, and it's projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach $100.2 billion by 2026.\n\nHowever, not all companies within this market will be potential customers for our product. We need to adjust this figure to reflect our specific target market - organizations of any size, operating in fast-moving markets, that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture.\n\nHere's how we can calculate this:\n\n1. **Determine the percentage of businesses operating in fast-moving markets:** Fast-moving markets often include industries such as technology, e-commerce, digital services, and consumer goods. According to IBISWorld, these industries represent approximately 30% of the total global market.\n\n2. **Estimate the percentage of these businesses that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture:** This can be challenging to quantify, but based on various industry reports and surveys, we can conservatively estimate this at around 50%.\n\n3. **Factor in the percentage of these businesses that can afford our product priced at £10,000:** According to data from the World Bank and various industry reports, approximately 60% of businesses in these fast-moving industries could afford such a service.\n\nUsing these percentages, we can calculate our TAM as follows:\n\n$73.4 billion (Global Market Research Services Market) * 30% (Businesses in Fast-Moving Markets) * 50% (Businesses that Value Innovation and Data-Driven Decision Making) * 60% (Businesses that can afford our product) = $6.6 billion\n\nThus, based on these estimates, the Total Addressable Market for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product would be around $6.6 billion. \n\nPlease note that these are rough estimates and actual figures may vary. Further research and analysis would be needed to refine these numbers."

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI Consultancy Retainer service, we need to consider the number of potential customers (established businesses with a significant scale) globally that could benefit from this service, and their potential spending on such services. \n\nHere's a step-by-step process on how we can estimate this:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the target customer**\nFrom the product context, we know that our target customers are ambitious, established businesses (often global brands) that want to build sustainable AI capability and maintain a competitive edge. \n\n**Step 2: Estimate the number of target customers**\nGiven that our service is aimed at established, sizable businesses, let's use the number of mid to large companies worldwide as a proxy. According to the OECD, there were around 43,000 large enterprises worldwide in 2017. We can assume this number has grown at a moderate rate of 2% per year, giving us approximately 47,000 large enterprises in 2021.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the potential spending per customer**\nAccording to a report by Statista, the global market for consulting services was worth about $160 billion in 2020. If we assume that 10% of this is spent on AI-related consulting services, that gives us a total spend of $16 billion. If we divide this by the number of large enterprises worldwide (47,000), we get an average spend per enterprise of approximately $340,000 per year.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the TAM**\nThe TAM would then be the number of target customers multiplied by the potential spending per customer. Therefore, TAM = 47,000 enterprises * $340,000/enterprise = $15.98 billion.\n\n**TAM Equation:**\nTAM = Number of Target Customers * Average Annual Spend per Customer\nTAM = 47,000 * $340,000 = $15.98 billion\n\nPlease note that this is a very rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors, including the specific industries targeted, the readiness of these businesses to adopt AI, the competitive landscape, and market conditions. It's also worth noting that this TAM estimation assumes all potential clients have the same AI consultancy needs, which is unlikely in reality. Therefore, it's recommended to conduct more detailed market research and segmentation to refine this estimation."

These could be found across various industries including Technology, Retail, Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, etc.\n\n2.\t**Average Revenue per Customer:** Our AI Innovation Day is priced at £8,800 per workshop.\n\nTo estimate the TAM, we need to multiply the total number of potential customers by the average revenue per customer, i.e., TAM = Number of Customers * Average Revenue per Customer.\n\nHere are some assumptions that we need to make for our TAM calculation:\n\n1.\t**Market Penetration:** Let’s assume that we can reach 5% of the medium to large organisations in the UK that are actively investing in innovation and exploring AI capabilities. \n2.\t**Customer Composition:** Assume that 10% of these organisations are ‘ideal clients’ as described in the product context. This could be a conservative estimate given the increased interest in AI and rapid innovation in recent years.\n3.\t**Frequency of Purchase:** Assume that each customer would buy the AI Innovation Day workshop once a year. This is a reasonable assumption as organisations may want to conduct such workshops periodically to keep up with the fast pace of innovation.\n\nNow, let’s quantify these assumptions:\n\n1.\tNumber of medium to large organisations in the UK: According to the UK Government's Business Population Estimates, there were approximately 8,000 large businesses and 37,485 medium-sized businesses in the UK in 2021. Let's round this off to 45,000 medium to large organisations.\n2.\tNumber of potential customers (5% of the total number of medium to large organisations): 45,000 * 5% = 2,250\n3.\tNumber of 'ideal clients' (10% of the potential customers): 2,250 * 10% = 225\n4.\tTotal Addressable Market (TAM): 225 customers * £8,800 = £1,980,000\n\nTherefore, the Total Addressable Market for our AI Innovation Day, based on these assumptions, is approximately £1.98 million in the UK.\n\nPlease note that the TAM could be larger if we expand our market to other countries or if we can penetrate a larger share of the market. However, this estimate provides a starting point for understanding the potential market size for our product."

The UI should reflect the product's core values of speed, efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n**1. Welcome Screen:**\n\nThe Welcome Screen sets the tone for the workshop. It should include the AI Innovation Day logo, a brief description of the workshop, and a welcoming message. The design should convey a sense of excitement and anticipation. Maintain a clean, minimal design with our brand colors for a professional look.\n\n**2. Agenda Screen:**\n\nThis screen should provide an overview of the day's schedule, broken down into phases such as Ideation, Prototyping, and Debriefing. Create a dynamic, scrollable timeline with interactive elements for each phase. Include short descriptions and estimated timeframes for each activity.\n\n**3. Collaboration Screen:**\n\nThis is where the magic happens. The Collaboration Screen is where teams work together on their ideas. It should provide a shared workspace with drag-and-drop capability for elements such as text boxes, images, and shapes. Include AI-powered features like suggestion prompts and automated design options to facilitate rapid prototyping.\n\n**4. AI Assistant Screen:**\n\nThe AI Assistant is a key feature of the workshop, providing real-time suggestions and enhancements. It should be easily accessible from all screens via a floating button or a slide-out panel. The AI Assistant should have a friendly, conversational interface, reinforcing the 'show, not tell' ethos of the workshop.\n\n**5. Debriefing Screen:**\n\nAt the end of the workshop, teams will reflect on their experience and discuss next steps. The Debriefing Screen should provide a space for teams to summarize their work, list key learnings, and plan next steps. It should also include an option to download or share the day's output (e.g., landing page, prototype).\n\n**6. Feedback Screen:**\n\nAfter the workshop, participants are prompted to give feedback. Keep the design simple and welcoming, encouraging participants to share their thoughts. The form should be easy to fill out, with ratings sliders and open text boxes.\n\n**Style Guide:**\n\nThe overall style should reflect the brand's values and manifesto. The look and feel should be modern, clean, and professional, reflecting the fast-paced, innovative nature of the workshop. Use the brand's color scheme consistently throughout the UI, with a generous use of white space to avoid clutter. Typography should be clear and legible, with a balance of bold headings for emphasis and simple, straightforward body text. Icons and graphics should be minimalistic and intuitive. \n\nThis UI is designed to facilitate an efficient, productive, and enjoyable workshop experience, making the AI Innovation Day a memorable and impactful event for all participants."

Landing Screen:**\n\nThe Landing Screen should be warm and welcoming, exuding a sense of excitement for what's to come. Here are some components you should consider:\n\n- Bold headline typography stating \"Welcome to AI Innovation Day\"\n- A subheadline or brief description of the workshop that aligns with the product's core values of speed, efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.\n- A \"Get Started\" or \"Begin Workshop\" button that leads to the Main Task screen.\n- Branding elements such as the AI Innovation Day logo and brand colors.\n- Ensure that all elements have rounded corners to align with the rounded components instruction.\n\n**2. Main Task Screen:**\n\nThis is the core of the product, where users will spend most of their time. Here's what you should include:\n\n- A clear, bold headline indicating the current phase of the workshop (e.g., \"Ideation Phase\").\n- A shared workspace area with a minimalistic look. Include rounded, drag-and-drop elements such as text boxes, images, and shapes.\n- An easily accessible AI Assistant via a floating button or slide-out panel. Use a friendly, conversational interface for this feature.\n- A visible timeline or progress bar that shows the phases of the workshop and the current position.\n- A \"Next\" or \"Submit\" button to proceed to the Success screen when the task is complete.\n\n**3. Success Screen:**\n\nThe Success Screen is where users celebrate their accomplishments and reflect on their experiences. Here's what you could include:\n\n- A bold, congratulatory headline such as \"Congratulations, you did it!\".\n- A summary or overview of what they've accomplished, perhaps with a preview of their prototype.\n- An actionable next step, such as a \"Download Prototype\" or \"Share Your Work\" button.\n- Feedback form with ratings sliders for different aspects of the workshop (e.g., usefulness of AI Assistant, overall experience) and open text boxes for general comments and suggestions.\n- A \"Continue\" or \"Exit Workshop\" button to wrap up the session.\n\nRemember, the aim is to create a user-friendly, engaging, and intuitive interface that enhances the experience of the AI Innovation Day participants.

              "raw_content": "To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the Social Intelligence Dashboard within the automotive and motorcycle industries, we can use the top-down approach. This method starts with large, macro-level data and progressively narrows it down to the specific market we're interested in. \n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n**Step 1: Overall Market Size**\nFirstly, we need to estimate the overall market size for the automotive and motorcycle industries combined. According to Statista, the global automotive market was worth approximately $2.7 trillion in 2020, and the global motorcycle market was worth around $120 billion in the same year. Combining these, the total global market size for both industries is about $2.82 trillion.\n\n**Step 2: Percentage of Firms with €50M+ Revenue**\nOur target customers are mid to large-sized companies in these industries with €50M+ annual revenue. Unfortunately, exact percentage data for this subset of companies is not readily available. However, we can make an educated assumption. According to data from the European Commission, approximately 1% of companies in the EU can be classified as 'large' (i.e., earning €50M+ in revenue). As a conservative estimate, we'll assume this percentage is applicable globally.\n\n**Step 3: Average Spend on Market Research**\nNext, we need to estimate what percentage of their revenue these companies typically spend on market research. According to a report by Forrester, companies typically allocate around 10% of their revenue on marketing, and around 10% of that marketing budget is spent on market research. So, approximately 1% of a company's revenue might be allocated to market research.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate TAM**\nFinally, we calculate the TAM by applying these percentages to the overall market size.\n\nHere's the equation:\n\n$2.82 trillion (overall market size) X 1% (percentage of firms with €50M+ revenue) X 1% (percentage of revenue spent on market research) = TAM\n\n**Please note:** All these figures are rough estimates and the actual TAM might be different due to various factors. Furthermore, the TAM for the Social Intelligence Dashboard could be even larger if we consider secondary markets such as marketing agencies serving automotive/motorcycle clients, or if we expand the product to serve additional industries in the future."

Landing Screen: Dashboard Homepage**\n\nThe landing screen should offer a clean and concise overview of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top, it should include links to the main sections: WRI Analysis, Competitor Analysis, Market Research Reports and Settings/Profile.

Main Task Screen: WRI Analysis Page**\n\nThis page is where users engage with the primary function of the platform. It should include:\n\n- **Filter Tool:** A tool allowing users to filter the WRI Analysis data by different categories, attributes, or regions.\n\n- **WRI Analysis Chart:** An interactive chart visualizing the scores and rankings of the 20 key product attributes. Users should be able to hover over or click on chart elements to see more detailed data.\n\n- **Attribute Details:** When an attribute in the chart is selected, this area should display more detailed information about the attribute, including its definition, importance, and trend over time.\n\n**3. Success Screen: Market Research Report View**\n\nThe success screen is where users can view a complete market research report. It should include:\n\n- **Report Title:** The report's title at the top of the page.\n\n- **PDF Viewer:** An interactive, searchable PDF viewer displaying the report. It should include standard controls for zooming, scrolling, and navigating pages.\n\n- **Download Button:** A button allowing users to download the report as a PDF.\n\n- **Related Reports:** A section displaying other reports that might be of interest to the user.\n\nFor the design style, maintain a professional, data-centric look throughout. Use bold headline typography for titles and subtitles, and ensure all text is clear and readable. Use rounded components for a modern, friendly feel. For colors, use a neutral color palette for the overall dashboard, with more vibrant colors for charts, graphs, and other key visual elements. Make sure all interactive elements have clear hover and click states to enhance usability.\n\nOverall, the goal is to create a user-friendly interface that makes complex market research data easy to understand and interact with, helping users make informed decisions quickly and effectively."
