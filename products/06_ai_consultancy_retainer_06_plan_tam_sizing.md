## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI Consultancy Retainer service, we need to consider the number of potential customers (established businesses with a significant scale) globally that could benefit from this service, and their potential spending on such services. 

Here's a step-by-step process on how we can estimate this:

**Step 1: Identify the target customer**
From the product context, we know that our target customers are ambitious, established businesses (often global brands) that want to build sustainable AI capability and maintain a competitive edge. 

**Step 2: Estimate the number of target customers**
Given that our service is aimed at established, sizable businesses, let's use the number of mid to large companies worldwide as a proxy. According to the OECD, there were around 43,000 large enterprises worldwide in 2017. We can assume this number has grown at a moderate rate of 2% per year, giving us approximately 47,000 large enterprises in 2021.

**Step 3: Estimate the potential spending per customer**
According to a report by Statista, the global market for consulting services was worth about $160 billion in 2020. If we assume that 10% of this is spent on AI-related consulting services, that gives us a total spend of $16 billion. If we divide this by the number of large enterprises worldwide (47,000), we get an average spend per enterprise of approximately $340,000 per year.

**Step 4: Calculate the TAM**
The TAM would then be the number of target customers multiplied by the potential spending per customer. Therefore, TAM = 47,000 enterprises * $340,000/enterprise = $15.98 billion.

**TAM Equation:**
TAM = Number of Target Customers * Average Annual Spend per Customer
TAM = 47,000 * $340,000 = $15.98 billion

Please note that this is a very rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors, including the specific industries targeted, the readiness of these businesses to adopt AI, the competitive landscape, and market conditions. It's also worth noting that this TAM estimation assumes all potential clients have the same AI consultancy needs, which is unlikely in reality. Therefore, it's recommended to conduct more detailed market research and segmentation to refine this estimation.
