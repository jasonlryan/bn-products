**Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Innovation Programme**

**Goal:**
The goal of the AI Innovation Programme is to facilitate a systematic process for medium to large sized companies to harness AI for innovation in product development and process improvement. The programme aims to provide end-to-end support from setting up an effective innovation process, facilitating ideation workshops, prototyping and testing AI solutions, to integrating AI into existing products/services and measuring the success of AI initiatives.

**Personas:**

1. **Tech-Driven Manufacturing Company:** This medium to large sized company is focused on product development and is already experimenting with basic AI applications in their operations. They aim to improve their product quality and reduce manufacturing time and costs through AI integration.

2. **Digital Marketing Agency:** A medium to large sized digital marketing agency that wants to leverage AI to provide innovative solutions to their clients. They aim to improve their service offering and client satisfaction through AI-driven innovation.

3. **Financial Services Firm:** This medium to large sized financial firm is focused on improving their service offerings and operational efficiency. They aim to leverage AI to improve their financial products, services and provide better customer service.

**User Stories:**

1. As a tech-driven manufacturing company, I want guidance on setting up an effective AI innovation process, so that we can systematically experiment with AI and turn it into tangible business results.
2. As a digital marketing agency, I want to participate in AI ideation workshops, so that we can brainstorm and prioritize AI solutions that can enhance our service offerings to clients.
3. As a financial services firm, I want support in prototyping and testing AI solutions, so that we can quickly identify and implement viable solutions in our financial services.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**

The MVP for the AI Innovation Programme includes:

1. Consulting on setting up an innovation process tailored to the client's needs.
2. Facilitation of at least one AI ideation workshop to brainstorm and prioritize AI solutions.
3. Support in prototyping and testing at least one AI solution.
4. Guidance on integrating the successful AI solution into the client's existing products/services.
5. Provision of a basic metrics and evaluation framework for the AI initiative.

**Success Metrics:**

1. Number of AI ideation workshops conducted.
2. Number of AI solutions prototyped and tested.
3. Number of successful AI solutions integrated into client's products/services.
4. Positive feedback from clients on the effectiveness of the AI Innovation Programme.
5. Improvement in client's AI maturity level post-programme.
6. Increase in client's efficiency, cost savings, and/or product/service improvements as a result of the AI solutions implemented.

**Risks:**

1. **Client Engagement:** The success of the AI Innovation Programme largely depends on the active participation and commitment of the client. Lack of engagement can hinder progress.
2. **AI Maturity:** While the programme is designed for companies with a medium level of AI maturity, those with very low or very high maturity may not fully benefit from the programme.
3. **R&D Budget:** The client must have a dedicated R&D budget to cover the costs associated with prototyping and testing AI solutions.
4. **Time Commitment:** While the programme is designed to accelerate the innovation process, it still requires a significant time commitment from the client.
5. **Market Changes:** Rapid changes in AI technology and market trends can impact the effectiveness and relevance of the AI solutions developed through the programme.
