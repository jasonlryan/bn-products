## Generated Output

**Functional Spec for AI Innovation Programme**

**Overview:**

The AI Innovation Programme is a comprehensive service designed to assist medium to large organizations in harnessing the potential of AI for product development and process improvement. It includes consulting, ideation workshops, prototyping and testing support, and guidance for integrating AI into existing products or services. It aims to provide a systematized approach for AI-driven innovation, turning AI experimentation into tangible business results.

**Inputs:**

1. **Client Briefing:** Information about the client's current AI maturity level, existing product/service details, and strategic goals.
2. **R&D Information:** Data regarding the client’s current R&D processes, project timelines, and budget.
3. **AI Ideation Workshop Participants:** A diverse group of participants from the client organization who will participate in the AI ideation workshops.
4. **Business Metrics:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) and other relevant metrics that the client uses to measure success.

**Process:**

1. **Consulting:** We start by having in-depth consultations with the client to understand their goals, current innovation processes, and AI maturity level. This input is used to customize the innovation process.
2. **AI Ideation Workshops:** We facilitate workshops with the client's team to ideate AI solutions. This process involves brainstorming, problem-solving, and prioritization of ideas.
3. **Prototyping and Testing:** Based on the output of the workshops, we support the client in prototyping and testing selected AI solutions. This is a rapid, iterative process designed to quickly identify viable solutions.
4. **Integration:** We guide the client on how to integrate the successful AI solutions into their existing products or services.
5. **Metrics and Evaluation:** We provide the client with metrics and evaluation frameworks to measure the success of their AI initiatives.

**Outputs:**

1. **Customized Innovation Process:** A bespoke process designed to facilitate continuous AI experimentation and innovation within the client's organization.
2. **AI Solution Prototypes:** Viable AI solutions that have been prototyped and tested.
3. **Integration Plan:** A roadmap for integrating the successful AI solutions into the client's existing products or services.
4. **Evaluation Framework:** A set of metrics and an evaluation framework for measuring the success of the AI initiatives.

**Limitations:**

1. **Client Engagement:** The success of the AI Innovation Programme largely depends on the active participation and commitment of the client.
2. **AI Maturity:** While the programme is designed for companies with a medium level of AI maturity, those with very low or very high maturity may not fully benefit from the programme.
3. **R&D Budget:** The client must have a dedicated R&D budget to cover the costs associated with prototyping and testing AI solutions.
4. **Time Commitment:** While the programme is designed to accelerate the innovation process, it still requires a significant time commitment from the client.
