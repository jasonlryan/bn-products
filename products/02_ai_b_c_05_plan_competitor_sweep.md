## Generated Output

**Competing Product 1: AI Academy by DataRobot**

**Value Proposition:** AI Academy by DataRobot offers a wide range of AI education programs designed to equip businesses with the knowledge and skills needed to build, implement, and manage AI systems. The programs are tailored to different roles within an organization, including executives, developers, and data scientists.

**Pricing:** Their standard AI literacy course is free, but the advanced courses for developers and data scientists are priced at £2,500 per course.

**Strengths:** DataRobot has a strong reputation in the AI industry, and their course content is comprehensive and well-structured. They also offer a mix of free and paid courses, making their programs accessible to a wide range of organizations.

**Weaknesses:** The courses are primarily online and self-paced, which may not be as effective as hands-on, instructor-led workshops. The advanced courses can also be expensive for some organizations.

**Gap We Exploit:** AI-B-C™ offers a more hands-on and interactive approach to learning, with expert-led workshops, webinars, and real-world project work. We also provide a custom learning plan tailored to each organization's specific needs, which DataRobot does not offer.

**Competing Product 2: Coursera for Business**

**Value Proposition:** Coursera for Business provides access to over 3,800 courses from top universities and industry-leading companies. Their AI courses cover a broad range of topics, from AI foundations to specialized applications.

**Pricing:** Their team plans start from £300 per user per year.

**Strengths:** Coursera offers a vast library of courses, providing organizations with a lot of flexibility and choice. They also have partnerships with top universities and companies, which adds credibility to their courses.

**Weaknesses:** The courses are mostly academic and theoretical, with less emphasis on practical, real-world applications. The learning experience is also less personalized, as the courses are not tailored to each organization's specific needs.

**Gap We Exploit:** AI-B-C™ focuses on real-world applications of AI, with hands-on workshops and project work. We also offer role-specific learning paths and a custom learning plan, providing a more tailored and relevant learning experience.

**Competing Product 3: Udacity for Enterprise**

**Value Proposition:** Udacity for Enterprise offers a range of AI and machine learning courses designed to upskill employees and drive digital transformation. Their courses are project-based and include mentor support.

**Pricing:** Their pricing is not publicly available and is provided upon request.

**Strengths:** Udacity's project-based approach to learning allows for practical application of knowledge. They also offer mentor support, which can enhance the learning experience.

**Weaknesses:** The pricing is not transparent, which can be a deterrent for some organizations. The courses may also be too technical for non-technical employees, limiting their appeal to a narrower audience.

**Gap We Exploit:** AI-B-C™ offers a modular curriculum and role-specific learning paths, making our programs accessible and relevant to all employees, regardless of their technical background. We also offer transparent pricing, making it easier for organizations to budget for our programs.
