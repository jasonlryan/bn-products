**1. Vision:**
We envision a future where AI is not just a technology tool, but a strategic imperative for businesses. We aim to guide organizations in leveraging AI's potential, helping them lead innovation in their industry, and ultimately shape the future.

**2. Problem:**
In the rapidly evolving world of technology, AI stands at the forefront of innovation and disruption. Many large enterprises and fast-rising scale-ups recognize AI's potential for growth and differentiation but lack the internal expertise and strategic direction to integrate it effectively. They risk falling behind, losing their competitive edge, or even facing disruption.

**3. Solution:**
Our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service is the bridge to this gap. We offer regular strategy sessions with AI experts, ongoing advisory services at the executive/board level, support in AI-related decision making, assistance with AI talent acquisition and development, and regular AI capability assessments and roadmap updates. We guide organizations from a state of low to medium AI maturity to a competitive advantage, cutting their learning time and leading the AI revolution in their industry.

**4. Market Opportunity:**
The global AI consulting market was valued at USD 6.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 33.5% from 2021 to 2028. Our service targets large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups in the United States that view AI as a strategic imperative and are in the early stages of AI maturity. This gives us a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of approximately $538 million in the United States alone.

**5. Positioning:**

**7. Competitive Landscape:**
Our main competitors include AI consulting services from Deloitte, Accenture, and Andrew Ng’s Landing AI. However, our unique value proposition of offering a more personalized service, continuous support, and specific focus on AI strategy for organizations with low to medium AI maturity allows us to exploit gaps in the market.

**8. Ask:**
We are seeking $XX million in funding to scale our operations, invest in marketing to reach more potential clients, and continue enhancing our service offerings. This funding will help us capture a greater share of the $538 million TAM.
