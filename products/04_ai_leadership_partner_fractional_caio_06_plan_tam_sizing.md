## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service, we can use the top-down market sizing approach. This involves identifying a larger market that we are part of, and then narrowing it down based on the proportion of the market that our service caters to.

Here's the step-by-step process:

**Step 1: Identify the Larger Market**

Our service is part of the larger AI consulting market. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global AI consulting market size was valued at USD 6.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% from 2021 to 2028. 

**Step 2: Narrow Down Based on Geographical Reach**

Let's assume our service is initially targeting clients in the United States. According to the same report, North America accounted for the largest share of the AI consulting market, with 40% of the total market in 2020.

Therefore, the size of the AI consulting market in the United States in 2020 was approximately $2.56 billion (40% of $6.4 billion).

**Step 3: Narrow Down Based on Client Size**

Our ideal client is a large enterprise or a fast-growing scale-up. According to data from the US Small Business Administration, large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups account for about 50% of the total number of businesses in the US.

Therefore, the size of our TAM in terms of client size is approximately $1.28 billion (50% of $2.56 billion).

**Step 4: Narrow Down Based on AI Maturity**

Our service is ideally suited to organizations with a low to medium AI maturity level. Based on a report by McKinsey, approximately 70% of businesses are still in the early stages of AI maturity.

Therefore, the size of our TAM in terms of AI maturity is approximately $0.896 billion (70% of $1.28 billion).

**Step 5: Narrow Down Based on Attitude Towards AI**

Our service targets organizations that view AI as a strategic imperative. According to a survey by Gartner, around 60% of organizations view AI as a strategic imperative.

Therefore, the final TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service is approximately $0.538 billion (60% of $0.896 billion).

**Summary:**

Based on the assumptions above, the TAM for our AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) service in the United States is approximately $538 million.

This is a rough estimate and the actual TAM could be higher or lower depending on various factors. For a more precise estimate, we would need more specific data on the number of large enterprises and fast-growing scale-ups in the US that view AI as a strategic imperative and are in the early stages of AI maturity.
