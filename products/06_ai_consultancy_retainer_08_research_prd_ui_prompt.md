## Generated Output

**UI PROMPT: AI CONSULTANCY RETAINER**

**Overall Style and Direction**
Reflective of the manifesto and the audience, the design style should be professional, clean, modern, and minimalistic. The UI should inspire confidence and trust, emphasizing expertise, partnership, and transformation. The colour scheme should be a mix of strong, stable colours (like dark blues or charcoal) combined with more vibrant, innovative colours (like bright azure or electric green) to signify the mix of stability and innovation that AI brings.

**1. Homepage / Landing Page**
This is the first impression of the service, so it should clearly communicate what the AI Consultancy Retainer service is, who it's for, and its key benefits. It should include:

- A hero section with a strong headline, a brief introduction of the service, and a call to action (CTA) to learn more or get in touch.
- Sections detailing the key features and benefits of the service, with concise, jargon-free language and relevant icons or images.
- Testimonials or case studies from previous clients to build credibility.
- A footer with contact information, social media links, and other relevant links.
  
**2. About Us Page**
This page should communicate the expertise and approach of the AI consultants. It should include:

- Brief bios of senior AI strategists and practitioners, highlighting their experience and expertise.
- An explanation of the unique approach to AI consultation, emphasizing the partnership model and focus on building internal AI capabilities.

**3. Services Page**
This page should provide a detailed overview of what the client is buying. It should include:

- Detailed descriptions of the key deliverables such as the consultancy calls, coaching/advisory sessions, AI literacy programmes, innovation sprints, etc.
- Optional add-ons or bespoke features that can be customized to the client's needs.
- A clear CTA to get in touch for a bespoke quote or to learn more.

**4. Resources Page**
This is the AI knowledge hub. It should include:

- A collection of resources such as articles, whitepapers, reports, and videos on AI adoption and strategy.
- Filter or search functionality to easily find relevant resources.
- Option to sign up for regular updates or newsletters.

**5. Contact Us Page**
This page will facilitate the initial connection between the client and the consultancy. It should include:

- A contact form for the client to share their details, their AI readiness level, and any specific questions or needs they have.
- Contact information such as email and phone number.
- Optional: A booking system to schedule an initial consultation call.

Remember, the UI should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation, legible fonts, and consistent styling. The focus should be on the content and the value the service provides, rather than the design elements themselves. The design should be fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience across all device types.
