# AI Innovation Programme • User Stories

Below are 10 structured user‑story cards for the AI Innovation Programme. Each card is grouped by persona and journey stage and follows the Agile format you requested. Acceptance Criteria are testable, Priority indicates importance, and Business Value explains why the story matters to the user.

---
Persona: CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)
Journey stage: Discovery

User Story:
As a CMO, I want a clear assessment of how the AI Innovation Programme can improve key marketing KPIs, so that I can decide whether the investment will increase campaign ROI by a measurable amount within 6 months.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A short assessment deck maps at least 3 core marketing KPIs (e.g., conversion rate, CAC, LTV) to expected programme outcomes.
2. The deck contains an ROI projection showing baseline vs projected KPI improvement and a rationale for the assumptions used.
3. At least two relevant client case studies are presented showing comparable KPI uplift within 6–12 months.
4. Stakeholder feedback (CMO + Head of Performance) is recorded and indicates whether the projected ROI is sufficient to proceed.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Helps the CMO make a data‑driven investment decision and sets realistic marketing outcome expectations to secure budget and executive support.

Persona: CMO
Journey stage: Evaluation

User Story:
As a CMO, I want to compare a defined 90‑day pilot outcome to our current roadmap, so that I can quantify potential speed and revenue gains before committing to a full programme.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A side‑by‑side comparison document shows current roadmap timelines vs projected 90‑day pilot deliverables for 2 candidate ideas.
2. Projected business outcomes (estimated revenue or efficiency gains) for each idea are quantified and sensitivity‑tested.
3. A clear go/no‑go decision checklist is supplied with measurable success thresholds for the pilot.
4. The CMO and Head of Product sign off the evaluation document or record concerns for follow‑up.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Allows marketing leadership to understand trade‑offs and value, reducing risk of investing in initiatives that don't accelerate revenue or speed to market.

Persona: Head of AI / CDO / VP Product
Journey stage: Discovery

User Story:
As Head of AI, I want a technical feasibility assessment of our stack and data readiness, so that I can be confident the programme can deliver a working prototype within 90 days.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A technical assessment identifies required data sources, access constraints, and integrations with existing systems.
2. A feasibility rating (Green/Amber/Red) is provided for each proposed prototype idea with mitigation plans for any Amber/Red items.
3. A timeline with key technical milestones and resource needs (internal + Brilliant Noise) is produced and agreed.
4. The Head of AI confirms feasibility findings or documents remaining technical blockers.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Reduces technical risk and prevents wasted effort by ensuring prototypes are grounded in real, accessible data and compatible with existing architecture.

Persona: Head of AI / CDO / VP Product
Journey stage: Purchase

User Story:
As Head of AI, I want contractual assurance on intellectual property and delivery cadence, so that the organisation can commit budget knowing pipeline predictability and IP rights are protected.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Contract or statement of work explicitly defines IP ownership or licensing terms for outputs, and is reviewed by legal.
2. Agreement includes delivery cadence (e.g., quarterly Test‑Learn‑Lead cycles) and minimum expected outputs per cycle.
3. Service level expectations (milestones, acceptance criteria for prototypes) are included and approved by procurement.
4. Budget approval is granted and a named executive sponsor is assigned.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Secures legal and governance clarity, enabling procurement to sign off and the organisation to commit resources with predictable returns.

Persona: Innovation Director
Journey stage: Evaluation

User Story:
As an Innovation Director, I want to see examples of patent‑worthy concepts and the validation criteria used, so that I can judge whether the programme is likely to produce protectable IP within 90 days.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A dossier of 2–3 anonymised example concepts (from prior clients) with descriptions of what made them patent‑worthy is provided.
2. A validation framework is supplied with clear, testable criteria used to judge patentability and commercial viability.
3. A proposed 90‑day prototype plan shows which validation steps map to patent filing triggers.
4. The Innovation Director confirms the framework is sufficient to evaluate IP potential or requests adjustments.

Priority: Should Have

Business Value:
Gives the innovation team confidence that effort will produce defensible, high‑value ideas—not just experiments—enabling prioritisation of R&D spend.

---
Persona: Innovation Director
Journey stage: Onboarding

User Story:
As an Innovation Director, I want a tailored capability‑building plan for my team, so that they can run quarterly Test‑Learn‑Lead cycles independently after the programme.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A training syllabus maps skills to roles and includes learning objectives, an 8‑week schedule, and assessment criteria.
2. At least one hands‑on sprint is scheduled during onboarding where the internal team co‑delivers a mini‑prototype with Brilliant Noise.
3. Competency baselines (pre/post) are recorded using a simple assessment and target proficiency levels defined.
4. The Innovation Director approves the plan and assigns participants.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Builds internal capability to sustain and scale innovation, reducing ongoing consultancy reliance and increasing speed of future cycles.

---
Persona: R&D Director / VP Product
Journey stage: Onboarding

User Story:
As an R&D Director, I want an integration plan that connects the programme’s prototypes into our existing product development pipeline, so that we can reduce time‑to‑market by 4x for validated features.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A documented integration workflow shows handoffs from prototype to product backlog, including definition of done for handover.
2. Resource allocation and sprint commitments are scheduled to accept at least one validated prototype within the next product sprint cycle.
3. Measurement plan specifies how speed improvements will be measured (baseline cycle time vs projected 4x acceleration).
4. Engineering lead signs off the integration plan and committed sprint capacity.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Ensures prototypes translate directly into product releases, preventing prototypes from stalling and delivering measurable acceleration in delivery.

---
Persona: R&D Director / VP Product
Journey stage: Success (post‑pilot, 90 days)

User Story:
As an R&D Director, I want clearly validated outcomes from the first 90‑day cycle, so that I can decide which prototypes to scale into product development with quantified impact.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. At least one prototype has passed the predefined validation criteria and a decision log records go/iterate/stop.
2. Quantified impact metrics (e.g., expected revenue, cost savings, performance improvements) are reported and compared to baseline.
3. A recommended next‑step plan is produced for scaling, including estimated engineering effort and timeline.
4. If applicable, an IP filing or provisional patent action has been initiated or a pathway documented.

Priority: Must Have

Business Value:
Provides the R&D leadership with the concrete evidence needed to invest further in scaling, minimising wasted development effort.

As a CEO/Strategy Executive, I want to see a recurring quarterly pipeline of validated AI concepts and an organisational capability metric, so that I can monitor compounding innovation value and report progress to stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. A quarterly pipeline dashboard shows at least N validated concepts (N agreed during purchase) and their stage (Validated / Scaling / Paused).
2. Capability metrics (e.g., number of trained staff, internal sprint leads, time‑to‑prototype) show improvement against the baseline.
3. Executive progress report summarises business impact (revenue, cost, strategic wins) and next quarter priorities.
4. Stakeholder satisfaction (survey) scores are collected and above the agreed threshold or action items are logged.

If you’d like, I can:
- Tailor acceptance thresholds (e.g., set N values or % targets) to your clients’ profile, or
- Convert these cards into a Jira/Asana import format (fields: summary, description, acceptance criteria, priority, business value).
