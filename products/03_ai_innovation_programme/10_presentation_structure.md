----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 7 — COMMON OBJECTIONS & SUGGESTED RESPONSES

- Objection: "We tried AI projects before and they failed."  
  Response: "Most fail because they lack a repeatable process. Our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ converts ad‑hoc tests into validated quarter‑cycle wins; we focus on rapid validation and business KPIs to avoid dead ends."

- Objection: "What about IP & legal?"  
  Response: "We embed IP governance into the programme. We design with patentability and provide templates/assessments as part of the pilot."

- Objection: "We can’t risk exposing data to third parties."  
  Response: "We offer on‑prem options, strict anonymisation, and secure enclaves. We adapt to your compliance requirements."

- Objection: "How do you measure success?"  
  Response: "We agree KPI success criteria in the discovery: business metrics (revenue, engagement), efficiency metrics (time saved), and technical metrics (model accuracy)."

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART 8 — SAMPLE TIMELINE TO FIRST PROTOTYPE (one slide to reuse)
- Week 0: Kickoff & discovery (1 week)
- Weeks 1–2: Ideation & hypothesis prioritisation
- Weeks 3–6: Rapid prototyping & internal testing
- Weeks 7–8: Live validation with users/stakeholders

----------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE TEMPLATES
- 30‑minute executive pitch: Use core slides 1–6, skip deep dives, end with 8–10. Leave 10 min for discussion.

- Discovery workshop intro (90 min): Core deck 20 min + moderated ideation session + immediate follow up to scope pilot.

----------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL NOTES
- Tone: Confident, consultative, outcome‑driven. Emphasise partnership and capability building (we’re not a vendor that hands off).
- Differentiators to weave throughout: Brighton boutique with global experience, B‑Corp values, marketing transformation heritage, Test‑Learn‑Lead™, leadership experience.
- Always close with a clear next step (Discovery Sprint / Alignment Workshop / Pilot proposal), calendar ask, and who signs off internally.

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a fillable slide‑by‑slide speaker note file for presenters,
- Create a 30‑60s case study video script,
- Build a starter ROI spreadsheet tailored to your top three verticals (finance, tech, CPG).
