# AI Innovation Programme • Market Sizing

Below is a concise, transparent TAM analysis for Brilliant Noise’s AI Innovation Programme (AIP). I run both a Top‑Down and a Bottom‑Up approach, show the formulas, list assumptions (and sources / logic where public data exists), produce TAM / SAM / SOM, give a ±20% sensitivity, and finish with three practical go‑to‑market implications.

Summary headline (base case)
- Top‑Down TAM ≈ £2.0bn p.a.
- Bottom‑Up TAM (preferred/illustrative) ≈ £5.0bn p.a.
- Recommended working TAM range (reconciling both) ≈ £2.0–£5.0bn p.a.
- Base case SAM (E&NA / priority sectors) ≈ £2.0bn p.a. (40% of bottom‑up TAM)
- SOM (near term / capacity constrained) ≈ £5–20m p.a.; attainable 5‑year SOM ≈ £10–40m p.a. (0.5–2% of SAM)

1) Market definition (primary market)
- Service: External AI innovation programmes (strategy + prototype + capability building) sold to medium→large enterprises with R&D/innovation budgets, buying external partners to accelerate AI-powered product/features/innovation.
- Geography for SAM focus: English‑language + core markets where Brilliant Noise sells today (Europe + North America) and sectors: Tech/SaaS, Finance, Consumer Brands (FMCG), Automotive, Industrial / Manufacturing, Pharma.

2) Top‑Down method
Goal: start from broad industry numbers and narrow to the sub‑segment.

Step A — inputs & sources
- Global consulting market (2023) ≈ $338bn (Statista, consulting market reports).
- Assumption: Digital transformation work ≈ 25% of consulting market (industry estimates; digital transformation is a major growth share).
- Assumption: AI advisory/implementation ≈ 15% of digital transformation spend.
- Assumption: AI innovation programmes (specialist innovation + productisation + prototyping) ≈ 20% of AI consulting (this is the niche Brilliant Noise competes in: innovation vs. implementation/infra).

Formula
- Top‑Down TAM (USD) = Global consulting market × %digital × %AI × %innovation
- Convert to GBP.

Calculation (base)
- $338bn × 25% = $84.5bn (digital transformation)
- $84.5bn × 15% = $12.675bn (AI consulting)
- $12.675bn × 20% = $2.535bn (AI innovation programmes)
- Convert to GBP (assume $1.25 = £1): £2.535bn / 1.25 ≈ £2.03bn

Top‑Down TAM ≈ £2.0bn p.a.

Notes / caveats
- Percentages are informed estimates. If AI consulting share is higher/lower or innovation share larger, TAM scales. Top‑down yields a conservative figure focused on the consultancy spend slice.

Sources / logic
- Statista consulting market size 2023; industry reports on digital transformation growth; logical splits to get to AI innovation niche.

3) Bottom‑Up method (recommended for go‑to‑market planning)
Goal: estimate number of target accounts × average annual spend on AIP.

Step B — inputs & assumptions (explicit)
- Target account definition: companies with revenue ≥ £200m (or >1,000 employees). These are the companies that typically have R&D/innovation budgets and buy external strategy+prototype capability.
- Assumption: Number of such target enterprises globally ≈ 25,000 (best‑guess—see logic below).
  - Logic: Fortune Global 2000 / national registries include a few thousand very large firms; adding mid‑market enterprises across developed markets yields low tens of thousands. (This is a model input that should be refined with a CRM/firmographic data vendor.)
- Assumption: Average annual external spend per target enterprise on AI innovation programmes (meaningful external partners, not internal dev) ≈ £200,000.
  - Rationale: AIP price starts at £25k per engagement; a full quarterly programme, ongoing prototyping, and capability building/retainer averages out higher — many customers buy multi‑phase programmes; £200k is a mid‑market average across large firms.
- Formula:
  - Bottom‑Up TAM = #target accounts × avg annual spend per account

Calculation (base)
- 25,000 × £200,000 = £5,000,000,000 = £5.0bn p.a.

Plausibility checks
- Low scenario (conservative): 15,000 accounts × £100k = £1.5bn
- High scenario (aggressive): 35,000 accounts × £400k = £14.0bn

Sources / logic
- Company counts: estimate based on global distribution of mid‑large enterprises; refine via Dun & Bradstreet / Orbis / LinkedIn Sales Navigator later.
- Average spend: combination of AIP price points, typical consultancy program spends, and market behavior for innovation programmes.

4) Reconciliation and recommended TAM
- Top‑Down ≈ £2.0bn (conservative consultancy-slice view)
- Bottom‑Up ≈ £5.0bn (best‑guess for all target enterprises’ external spend)
- Recommendation: treat TAM as a range £2–5bn p.a. (use bottom‑up for GTM planning; top‑down as conservative market ceiling for consulting spend slice).

5) SAM and SOM (formulas + numbers)
- SAM (Serviceable Available Market) = fraction of TAM reachable given Brilliant Noise’s language, geography, sector focus and go‑to‑market reach.
  - Assumption: initial SAM = 40% of TAM (Europe + North America + core sectors).
  - Base SAM (using bottom‑up TAM £5.0bn) = 0.40 × £5.0bn = £2.0bn.
  - If you prefer the top‑down basis, SAM = 0.40 × £2.0bn = £0.8bn. Use the bottom‑up SAM (£2.0bn) for growth planning.
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) = realistic share you can capture given capacity, competition and time horizon.
  - Near‑term (next 12–24 months) SOM (capacity constrained) — estimate by delivery capacity:
    - Example: if Brilliant Noise can deliver 40 full programmes/year at avg £125k = £5.0m revenue (current practical SOM).
  - 3‑5 year SOM (ambitious growth) — assume capture of 0.5–2% of SAM:
    - 0.5% × £2.0bn = £10m
    - 1.0% × £2.0bn = £20m (mid)
    - 2.0% × £2.0bn = £40m (stretch)
  - So 5‑year SOM ≈ £10–40m (realistic target band).

6) Sensitivity table (±20% on the two key Bottom‑Up assumptions)
Key assumptions: #target accounts (25,000) and avg spend (£200k).
We vary each by ±20% and show TAM, SAM (40%), SOM (1% of SAM as mid scenario).

- Variables:
  - Accounts low = 25,000 × 0.8 = 20,000
  - Accounts high = 25,000 × 1.2 = 30,000
  - Spend low = £200k × 0.8 = £160k
  - Spend high = £200k × 1.2 = £240k

Table (scenarios)
- Low/Low (−20% both): 20,000 × £160k = £3.2bn TAM → SAM = £1.28bn → SOM (1%) = £12.8m
- Base: 25,000 × £200k = £5.0bn TAM → SAM = £2.0bn → SOM (1%) = £20.0m
- High/High (+20% both): 30,000 × £240k = £7.2bn TAM → SAM = £2.88bn → SOM (1%) = £28.8m

Also show asymmetric impact (for clarity)
- Accounts high / Spend low: 30,000 × £160k = £4.8bn TAM
- Accounts low / Spend high: 20,000 × £240k = £4.8bn TAM
(so TAM is roughly linear in either variable; both moving together explains the spread £3.2–£7.2bn around central £5.0bn)

7) Assumptions & areas to validate (actionable next steps)
Top items to validate to tighten the model:
- Precise number of target accounts by industry & geography (buying intent filters: R&D spend > X, innovation org in place). Pull from Orbis / D&B / LinkedIn.
- Real average contract value (ACV) per customer for an AIP engagement and expected renewal/retainer / number of engagements per year per client.
- Market allocation: what percent of AI consulting dollars go to innovation vs engineering vs ops — refine with industry surveys (e.g., McKinsey, Gartner, IDC reports).

8) Three implications for go‑to‑market (practical)
1. Prioritise a narrow set of target accounts/sectors (Account‑Based Marketing)
   - The SAM is concentrated: target 1–2 sectors where Brilliant Noise has demonstrable case studies (e.g., Consumer Brands + SaaS). Use firmographic filters (revenue >£200m, headcount >1,000, active AI pilots) to focus sales effort on the ~1–3k highest‑likelihood accounts in the first 24 months to maximize win rate and shorten sales cycles.

2. Productise fixed‑scope AIP packages and a clear pricing ladder
   - Given average spend uncertainty, offer a small basket of standardised packages (Pilot: £25–75k; Quarterly Programme: £125–250k; Enterprise Retainer/Scale: £500k+) so buyers can self‑select and procurement is simplified—this increases conversion and predictability, improving SOM.

3. Scale via partnerships and proof points to expand SAM/SOM
   - To move from near‑term SOM (£5–20m) to a multi‑£10m business, scale beyond direct delivery: partner with systems integrators and platform vendors for referrals; create case studies showing "4x faster feature shipping" and "patent‑worthy prototypes", and publish concrete ROI (time→revenue or cost saved) to justify higher ACVs and win enterprise procurement.

Closing note
- Bottom‑Up gives a practical working TAM of ~£5.0bn with a reasonable SAM of £2.0bn and an immediate SOM tied to capacity (£5–20m now; £10–40m over 3–5 years). The Top‑Down £2.0bn is a useful conservative cross‑check focused on consultancy spend. I recommend using the Bottom‑Up base for GTM planning, and prioritising the validation steps above to tighten the numbers (firmographic counts and real ACV data from CRM / target lists).

If you want, I can:
- Run a tighter bottom‑up by geography (UK / EMEA / US split) using firmographic data, or
- Build an acquisition capacity model (how many AIP engagements / year you can deliver at current team size, and how hiring scales revenue/SOM).
