- Role: Head of AI, Chief Digital Officer, VP Product (AI-led products)  
- Company size: 1,000–10,000 employees; £200M–£2B annual revenue  
- Industry: SaaS, platform businesses, enterprise software

### Motivations
- Keep product differentiation versus fast-moving competitors (goal: release 2–4 meaningful AI features per year).  
- Accelerate product roadmap velocity (target: 3–6 months from prototype→production).  
- Protect IP and build defensible AI assets (aim: 1–2 patent filings per year tied to product features).  
- Demonstrate measurable ARR uplift from AI features (target: +10–20% ARR contribution within 12 months).

### Pain Points
- Fragmented experiments with low conversion: prototype→product conversion rate <10%.  
- Long development cycles and engineering backlog (typical feature slippage 6–12 months).  
- Difficulty integrating research prototypes with product engineering and infra.  
- Risk of wasting R&D budget on dead ends; need faster validation with business KPIs.

### Success Looks Like
- Deliver 3 validated AI prototypes per quarter that pass business KPIs within 90 days.  
- Reduce time-to-market for AI features from 12 months to 3 months (4x faster).  
- Achieve prototype→production conversion ≥40% within 12 months.  
- File 1–2 patent applications within 6–12 months tied to programme outputs.  
- New AI features contribute +10–20% incremental ARR within 12 months of launch.

### Budget Authority
- Can approve pilots and innovation engagements of £100k–£500k from digital/R&D budgets.  
- Requires CFO/Procurement sign-off for investments >£500k or multi-quarter commitments.

### Buying Process
- Typical evaluation timeline: 6–12 weeks to vendor short-list and pilot decision.  
- Stages: discovery → 6–8 week pilot (proof-of-value) → governance review → scale.  
- Key stakeholders: Head of AI, VP Product, Head of Engineering, Procurement, Legal (IP).  
- Evaluation criteria: speed to validated prototype, integration risk, IP ownership, measurable KPIs (time-to-value, uplift in usage/ARR), vendor’s productisation track record.  
- Prefers providers that can embed with internal teams (Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach), deliver IP, and demonstrate fast prototypes.

- Company size: 5,000–50,000 employees; £1B–£50B annual revenue  
- Industry: Consumer Packaged Goods, Food & Beverage, FMCG

### Motivations
- Steer faster, less risky product innovation cycles that protect brand equity.  
- Deliver new product lines or features that open revenue streams (target: 2–3 new SKUs or revenue-generating concepts/year).  
- Capture defendable IP and first-mover advantage in adjacent categories.  
- Reduce cost of failed experiments and speed consumer validation.

### Pain Points
- Product development cycles of 12–24 months create slow ROI and missed market windows.  
- R&D silos and limited AI/engineering capability for rapid prototyping.  
- High cost of physical prototyping and consumer testing without validated digital signals.  
- Regulatory and compliance complexity in food/ingredients prolongs validation.

### Success Looks Like
- Generate patent-worthy, consumer-validated AI concepts within 90 days (goal: 2 patentable concepts per 6 months).  
- Produce a pipeline of 6 validated innovation concepts per year, with at least 2 routed to commercialization.  
- Reduce failed experiments by 50–60% via rapid digital validation and AI-assisted ideation.  
- Shorten NPD cycle from 18 months to ≤4–6 months for AI-enabled propositions.

### Budget Authority
- Can commit £250k–£1M from R&D/innovation budgets for pilots and capability programmes.  
- Larger cross-category rollouts (>£1M) require CFO and Business Unit Head approval.

### Buying Process
- Typical evaluation timeline: 8–16 weeks (longer due to compliance checks).  
- Stages: stakeholder alignment → pilot in one category → consumer/prototype validation → scale to other business units.  
- Key stakeholders: Head of Innovation, R&D leads, Legal (IP/compliance), Consumer Insights, Procurement, Category Directors.  
- Evaluation criteria: speed of validation, consumer signal quality, regulatory compliance, cost per validated concept, IP creation.  
- Prefers partners who can run industry-specific ideation workshops, rapid prototyping and bridge digital prototypes to physical testing (Test‑Learn‑Lead™ mapping to NPD).

## ICP 3 — Chief Marketing Officer (Global Brand / Retail)

### Profile
- Role: Chief Marketing Officer, Head of Digital Transformation, VP Customer Experience  
- Company size: 2,000–30,000 employees; £500M–£20B annual revenue  
- Industry: Retail, Consumer Goods, Direct-to-Consumer brands

### Motivations
- Transform marketing to be AI-first: personalised customer journeys and automated creative at scale.  
- Drive measurable commercial KPIs: conversion, retention, and LTV (targets: +15–25% conversion lift; +10–15% retention uplift).  
- Reduce time and cost of campaign production (target: −50% to −70% production time).  
- Build internal capability so marketing runs continuous AI experiments (goal: 1 experiment/week per team).

### Pain Points
- Many AI pilots never operationalised; low ROI from experimentation.  
- Marketing ops and creative processes are slow and manual.  
- Shortage of in-house AI product and data capability; reliance on agencies for one-off projects.  
- Difficulty measuring direct business impact of AI experiments.

### Success Looks Like
- Ship AI-powered marketing features that increase conversion rate by 15–25% within 6 months.  
- Reduce campaign production time by 50–70% and cost per campaign by 30% within 3–6 months.  
- Establish a repeatable innovation cadence: one validated idea deployed every quarter; 12 smaller A/B experiments per quarter.  
- Demonstrate ROI on programme within 90–180 days (payback period under 6 months on pilot spend).

### Budget Authority
- Discretionary marketing/innovation budget control: £75k–£400k for pilots and capability programmes.  
- Larger transformation spends (>£400k) typically require CEO/CFO endorsement.

### Buying Process
- Typical evaluation timeline: 4–10 weeks to run a discovery and short pilot.  
- Stages: discovery & KPI alignment → sprint workshop(s) → 4–12 week prototype → measurement → scale.
