# AI Innovation Programme • Pricing Roi

Business Model Canvas (concise)
- Key partners: AI platform providers (OpenAI, Anthropic), cloud infra (AWS/GCP), academic labs, nearshore engineering partners, IP/legal firms.
- Key activities: Test‑Learn‑Lead™ sprints, prototype development, capability workshops, IP capture, customer success.
- Key resources: Senior AI consultants, principal engineers, design leads, proprietary playbooks & prompt libraries, demo infrastructure.
- Cost structure: Direct delivery cost (£80/hr fully loaded), tooling & infra (£2k–£8k per project), sales & marketing (£15k CAC mid‑deal), G&A & platform (£20k/month).
- Revenue streams: One‑off engagements (pilot £25k+, programmes £75k–£250k+), retainers (monthly innovation ops), licensing/IP share, training workshops.

Unit Economics (specific numbers & assumptions)
Assumptions:
- Fully loaded cost per consultant hour = £80.
- Target bill rate = £250/hr (value‑based).
- Typical project hours: Pilot = 100 hrs (£25k); Quarterly programme = 300 hrs (£75k); Enterprise annual = 1,000 hrs (£250k).

Per‑project economics:
- Pilot (£25k): Revenue/hr £250; Cost = 100*£80 = £8k; Gross profit = £17k; Gross margin = 68%.
- Quarterly (£75k): Cost = 300*£80 = £24k; Gross profit = £51k; Margin = 68%.
- Enterprise (£250k): Cost = £80k; Gross profit = £170k; Margin = 68%.

Breakeven (fixed costs)
- Fixed annual GTM & platform allocation = £240k (assumption).
- Equivalent contributions required: 240k / £51k ≈ 4.7 → ~5 quarterly programmes p.a. (or 15 pilots) to breakeven.
Actionable: Target landing 1–2 mid‑tier engagements/month to be cash‑positive within 6 months.

Pricing Strategy
- Model: Value‑based, tiered pricing with outcome/success element for enterprise deals.
  - Entry pilot: £25k (loss‑leader / conversion driver).
  - Core quarterly: £75k (standard ROI sweet spot).
  - Enterprise programme: £250k+ (includes success fee / IP/licensing options).
- Competitive positioning: Premium boutique — charge a 10–25% premium vs engineering houses by selling speed (4x faster), IP potential and bespoke strategy.
- Price testing framework:
  1. A/B offer variations (pilot discount vs bundled retainer) on live pipeline for 90 days.
  2. Win/loss interviews to elicit WTP and perceived ROI.
  3. Time‑limited anchoring: publish “from £25k” but show standard case study anchors (£75k, £250k).
Actionable: Introduce a performance bonus (10–20% of realised revenue uplift) for enterprise pilots to increase willingness to pay.

Scalability Analysis
- Capacity constraints: Senior consultant availability is the bottleneck; client data engineering dependencies slow delivery.
- Path to scale:
  1. Productise Playbooks: convert repeatable sprint steps into packaged modules reducing senior hours by 30%.
  2. Build a nearshore engineering bench to expand delivery capacity at lower cost.
  3. Partner with platform vendors for preferred‑partner credits to lower infra cost and speed deployments.
- Automation opportunities:
  - Reusable prompt libraries, pre‑wired data connectors, automated MLOps templates and prototype scaffolds — can reduce engineering hours per project by 40–50% over 12 months.
Actionable: Invest one senior FTE + 2 devs for 6 months to productise core playbooks; expect 30% uplift in gross margin on scaled deals.

ROI Framework (customer view, three scenarios)
Assumptions for a representative client (annual revenue £500M, baseline conversion 2%):
- Metric: incremental revenue from AI feature = lift * revenue.
Scenarios for a single prototype (investment £75k):
1. Conservative: 0.05pp conversion lift → incremental revenue = £250k/year.
   - ROI = (£250k − £75k) / £75k = 233%; Payback ≈ 0.3 years (3–4 months).
2. Base: 0.25pp lift → incremental = £1.25M/year.
   - ROI = (1.25M − 75k)/75k = 1567%; Payback ≈ 0.06 years (~3 weeks).
3. Aggressive: 0.5pp lift + cost savings/IP licensing → incremental = £2.5M/year.
   - ROI >> 3000%; Payback under 1 month.
Value metrics to track: time‑to‑market reduction, probability‑adjusted revenue uplift, cost avoidance, IP value.
Actionable: Use standard ROI calculator in sales cycles — show client payback and scenario probabilities to justify price.

Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell opportunities: Full engineering build, hosting/ops, IP licensing, enterprise subscriptions for continuous innovation, leadership training packages.
- Recurring revenue potential: Monthly retainers (£10k–£40k/month) for innovation ops and advisory; platform subscriptions for tooling (£2k–£10k/month).
- CLTV (example):
  - Avg annual revenue per client after expansion = £150k.
  - Expected lifetime = 3 years → revenue = £450k.
  - Gross margin 68% → gross profit £306k.
  - Less average CAC £15k → CLTV ≈ £291k.
Actionable: Convert 30% of pilots into 12‑month retainers (avg £15k/month) to materially increase CLTV and smooth cash flow.

Key takeaways (action items)
- Use £25k pilots as conversion vehicles; prioritise margin on mid/enterprise programmes.
- Productise 20–30% of delivery to remove senior bottlenecks and raise margins.
- Institutionalise ROI storytelling in sales (3 scenarios + payback) to shorten sales cycles and increase ASP.
- Target 5+ quarterly programmes per year to cover fixed costs; target 30% pilot→retainer conversion to maximise CLTV.
