# AI Innovation Programme • Qa Prep

1) Question: What is the addressable market and why is now the right time?
Answer: The market is enterprise marketing and product R&D teams adopting AI to accelerate feature development and customer experience; adoption is accelerating now due to generative AI maturity, rising C-suite mandates, and R&D budget reallocation toward AI.  
Follow-up: We can share our TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown and recent win rates by vertical on request.

2) Question: How do you know customers will pay for this service versus building in-house?
Answer: Customers pay because we convert ad‑hoc experiments into a predictable quarterly pipeline that demonstrably ships product features 4x faster and reduces costly dead-ends—tangible commercial outcomes procurement and innovation heads fund.  
Follow-up: Ask for three reference case studies showing ROI and procurement rationale.

3) Question: What is your moat vs. large consultancies, pure tech implementers, and agencies?
Answer: Our moat is a blended combination of a proven proprietary Test‑Learn‑Lead™ process, marketing transformation heritage, boutique senior expertise, and B‑Corp trust—delivering practical, repeatable outcomes rather than generic strategy or pure implementation.  
Follow-up: See our competitive positioning grid and client feedback comparisons.

4) Question: Is this scalable or just a high‑touch boutique service?
Answer: The core service is high‑value and bespoke, but we package repeatable modules, playbooks, and accelerators that let us scale delivery across clients without diluting senior involvement.  
Follow-up: Request our delivery model showing modularisation and resource leverage.

5) Question: What are your revenue streams and pricing logic?
Answer: Revenue comes from fixed innovation programmes (starting at £25k), larger multi‑quarter engagements, and capability-building retainers; pricing reflects value delivered (speed to market, patentable prototypes) rather than time-and-materials.  
Follow-up: We’ll walk you through sample pricing tiers and customer contract templates.

6) Question: What are the unit economics and expected margins?
Answer: As a premium professional services offering, we target industry‑typical healthy gross margins (driven by senior-led design + junior delivery leverage) and strong lifetime value from repeat quarterly engagements and retainers.  
Follow-up: Ask for our anonymised unit-economics model and typical project P&L.

7) Question: What is your customer acquisition cost and payback period?
Answer: CAC is driven by enterprise sales and strategic partnerships and tends to be front‑loaded, with payback typically achieved within 6–12 months through follow‑on projects and retained capability work.  
Follow-up: We can share historical CAC, sales cycle length, and LTV estimates for investors.

8) Question: Do you have the team to deliver repeatable, technical AI outcomes at scale?
Answer: Our leadership has 15+ years of digital transformation experience, and we combine senior strategists with an AI‑capable delivery bench and partner ecosystem to scale while keeping senior oversight on each programme.  
Follow-up: Request bios, hiring plan, and partner network details.

9) Question: What is your go‑to‑market strategy for hitting growth targets?
Answer: We target CMOs, CDOs and innovation leaders at mid‑to‑large enterprises via direct enterprise sales, strategic partner channels, proof‑of‑value pilots with marquee clients, and thought leadership rooted in B‑Corp credibility.  
Follow-up: See our GTM playbook, ICP segmentation, and current pipeline.

10) Question: What are the biggest execution risks and how do you mitigate them?
Answer: Key risks are long enterprise sales cycles, client change-resistance, and delivery complexity; we mitigate these with short 90‑day validated prototypes, executive stakeholder alignment workshops, and templates that reduce implementation friction.  
Follow-up: We’ll share our risk register and three recent mitigation case studies.

11) Question: How defensible are the innovations you help build—can competitors copy them?
Answer: Defensibility comes from jointly owned patent‑worthy prototypes for clients, our process IP, proprietary accelerators, and deep client domain knowledge; commercial defensibility is reinforced by integration into clients’ products and teams.  
Follow-up: Ask to review anonymised examples of patentable outputs and our IP engagement terms.

12) Question: How do you handle client data, privacy, and regulatory risk?
Answer: We operate under strict GDPR and enterprise data controls, offer on‑prem/VPC or synthetic‑data workflows, execute Data Processing Agreements and vendor security assessments, and can align to client compliance frameworks before any integration.  
Follow-up: Request our data‑privacy playbook, security checklist, and sample DPA.
