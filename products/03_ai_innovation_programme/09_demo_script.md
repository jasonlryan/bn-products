# AI Innovation Programme • Demo Script

Hook (10s)
(0:00–0:10)  
"Imagine shipping AI-powered features every quarter — not every year. What if your R&D turned into a predictable pipeline of commercial wins, not one-off experiments?"

Context (20s)
(0:10–0:30)  
"Hi, I’m [Name] from Brilliant Noise — a Brighton-based, B‑Corp digital consultancy founded in 2009. We help CMOs and CDOs turn AI from risk into repeatable growth using our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ process. Our AI Innovation Programme (from £25,000) sets up the process, builds prototypes and upskills your team so you get patent-worthy breakthroughs in 90 days."

Live Flow — 7 steps (84s)
(0:30–1:54)  
Step 1 — Kick-off & alignment (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We start by aligning business goals and KPIs."  
"What we say: ‘Day one we map your top priorities and agree measurable outcomes — revenue, time-to-market, IP targets.’"

Step 2 — Data & capability health-check (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We’ll surface your usable data and integration risk."  
"What we say: ‘Quick audit of data, models and tech stack to find low-friction wins.’"

Step 3 — AI-powered ideation workshop (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We’ll run an ideation session using AI to accelerate creativity."  
"What we say: ‘We generate dozens of concepts, cluster into bold bets, and pull out the ones that hit your KPIs.’"

Step 4 — Prioritisation & sprint roadmap (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We prioritise by value vs. effort and patent potential."  
"What we say: ‘We pick two high-impact prototypes and lay out a 30–90 day sprint plan.’"

Step 5 — Rapid prototyping (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We build lightweight, testable prototypes fast."  
"What we say: ‘Our engineers and designers build demos you can test with customers in weeks, not months.’"

Step 6 — Validation & IP filter (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We validate metrics and flag protectable ideas."  
"What we say: ‘We run user tests, measure outcomes, and identify patent-worthy concepts to protect commercial value.’"

Step 7 — Integrate, scale & capability transfer (12s)  
Spoken cue: "We handover to your teams and set up the next quarter."  
"What we say: ‘We connect prototypes into your R&D pipeline, train your people, and leave you set to repeat the cycle next quarter.’"

Wow Moment — One-liner (6s)
(1:54–2:00)  
"Quarterly, patent-ready AI breakthroughs — shipped four times faster than traditional R&D."

Objection Handling — 2 quick counters (36s)
(2:00–2:36)  
Objection 1 — "That sounds expensive." (18s)  
Counter: "We start pilots from £25k to de-risk the work. The aim is measurable value — faster time-to-market, clear revenue or cost KPIs — so the pilot should pay for itself before you scale."

Objection 2 — "We already have an R&D team." (18s)  
Counter: "Great — we don’t replace them. We turbocharge them with a repeatable process, tooling and IP discipline so experiments actually turn into productised, protectable outcomes every quarter."

Call to Action (24s)
(2:36–3:00)  
"If you’re a CMO, CDO or Innovation lead and want a predictable AI pipeline, let’s set a 20–minute executive briefing this week. We’ll scope a 90‑day pilot and show what we could deliver for your top use case — starting from £25k. Reply to this message or ask your Brilliant Noise contact to schedule the briefing. Ready to see the first 90 days mapped out?"
