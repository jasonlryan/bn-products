# AI Innovation Programme • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — Go‑to‑Market for AI Innovation Programme
Brilliant Noise (Brighton) — B‑Corp, Test‑Learn‑Lead™ methodology

Purpose: Practical, step‑by‑step GTM playbook to scale the AI Innovation Programme from boutique delivery to a repeatable, scalable revenue engine and 10x revenue growth. Replace baseline assumptions with your internal numbers where noted.

Assumptions (replace with your actuals)
- Typical AIP price (ACV): £75k (range £25k–£250k). Use average £75k for modelling.
- Current throughput (example baseline): 8 active/complete programmes per year → revenue ≈ £600k.
- Target: 10x revenue → £6.0m ARR from AIP pipeline.
- Average engagement duration: 90 days (quarterly cadence).
- Current core team supporting AIP: 6 people (strategy / design / ML prototyping / PM / delivery lead / client success).
All growth calculations below include a flexible model so you can swap your numbers.

1) Channel Strategy — Primary & Secondary Channels (with rationale)
Primary channels (direct, highest ROI & control)
- Enterprise Sales / Account‑Based Marketing (ABM) to ICPs (CMOs, CDOs, Heads of AI, Innovation Directors)
  - Rationale: high ACV, relationship sales required, consultative selling. Matches your positioning and existing brand equity with global brands.
- Strategic Partnerships with Cloud & AI vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Rationale: co‑sell opportunities, credibility, technical enablement, faster enterprise procurement.
- Existing client expansion / cross‑sell (client success-led)
  - Rationale: low CAC, high conversion; leverage case studies (adidas, BMW, Nestle).

Secondary channels (broader reach, lead generation & thought leadership)
- Thought leadership content (LinkedIn, long‑form POVs, industry whitepapers, webinars)
  - Rationale: builds credibility with C‑suite and innovation leads.
- Industry events & executive roundtables (finance, retail, consumer goods conferences)
  - Rationale: direct access to innovation budgets and peer influence.
- Referral & alliance network (innovation hubs, VCs, accelerators, universities)
  - Rationale: warm introductions to funded/innovation‑ready orgs.

2) Scalability Roadmap — How to grow to 10x revenue (phased, numerical)
Structure: 0–6 months (stabilise), 6–18 months (scale repeatability), 18–36 months (scale coverage & productise).

Stage A — 0–6 months: Standardise & Prove (goal: 2x baseline)
- Actions:
  - Standardise AIP playbook (templates, SOWs, KPIs, IP assignment, pricing tiers).
  - Run 3–4 flagship programme deliveries with tightened quality gates and measurable ROI case studies.
  - Launch ABM pilot (target 25 named accounts), start 2 partner conversations (cloud + 1 system integrator).
- Metrics / Milestones:
  - SOPs & delivery checklist completed.
  - 4 validated case studies with outcome metrics.
  - MQL → SQL conversion baseline established (e.g., 25%).
- Capacity:
  - Deliverable capacity unchanged; improve utilisation by 10–15% via playbook.

Stage B — 6–18 months: Scale GTM & Delivery (goal: 3–5x baseline)
- Actions:
  - Hire 2 Senior Delivery Leads and 4 specialists (ML engineer, product designer, innovation strategist, client success).
  - Set up 2 delivery pods; each pod can run 3 concurrent 90‑day programmes/year (9 programmes/pod/year assuming partial overlap).
  - Deploy SDRs (1 SDR per 1.5 AE) and 1 AE focused on high‑value accounts.
  - Formalise partner agreements (co‑sell, referral fees).
- Metrics / Milestones:
  - Engagements/year ≈ 24–36 (depends on pod efficiency).
  - Revenue target checkpoint at ~£1.8m–£2.7m.
- Capacity constraints:
  - Hiring lead time 8–12 weeks; onboarding productivity ramp 3 months.
  - Tooling required: CRM, project ops, prototype infra.

Stage C — 18–36 months: Productise & Expand (goal: 10x baseline)
- Actions:
  - Productise modular offerings (packaged sprints, “Innovation-as-a-Service” subscription, IP licensing).
  - Expand AEs + SDRs by 3x; open office / hiring in US time zone for enterprise sales.
  - Create a partner ecosystem: cloud, SI, domain consultancies, patent/legal partners.
  - Build a training/academy to scale capability building revenue stream.
- Metrics / Milestones:
  - Engagements/year target ≈ 80 (example to reach £6m at £75k ACV).
  - Revenue £6m; gross margin target 50%+.
- Capacity needs (example staffing to hit 80 engagements/year):
  - Delivery pods: 8 pods (each running ~10 engagements/year) = 8 × pod teams.
  - Pod composition (per pod): 1 Delivery Lead (senior), 1 Product Designer, 1 ML/Prototype Engineer, 0.5 Strategy Lead, 0.5 Client Success = ~4 FTE per pod.
  - Total delivery headcount ≈ 32 FTE + 12 supporting roles (sales, marketing, ops, partnerships, legal).

6) Sales Process — qualification, conversion, onboarding
Sales stages & playbook
- Stage 0: Target identification (ABM list) → Prospecting (SDR outreach).
- Stage 1: Discovery Call (30–60 min) — qualification of fit, budget range, exec sponsor, data readiness, success metrics.
  - Use qualifying checklist: Budget (R&D budget confirmed), Authority (exec sponsor engaged), Need (strategic AI priority), Timeline (90–180 days), Data (access & quality).
- Stage 2: Solution Workshop (Paid/Free) — 1‑day executive workshop to align objectives and scope.
- Stage 3: Proposal & SOW — fixed‑price 90‑day sprint + options for scale/implementation.
  - Pricing tiers: Proof Sprint (£25k entry), Standard Programme (£75–150k), Enterprise Pilot (£150k+).
- Stage 4: Contracting & Onboarding (1–2 weeks) — legal, IP, data access, kick‑off.
- Stage 5: Delivery & Validation — migration to delivery pod; customer success owners begin.
Conversion metrics & playbook
- SLAs: response to inbound within 24 hours; outbound response within 72 hours.
- Negotiation play: lock core deliverables, keep production implementation as separate SOW to protect margin and prevent scope creep.
- Objection handling: provide exemplar ROI metrics, IP/patent pathway, and vendor neutrality (non‑vendor lock).
Onboarding checklist (first 30 days)
- Exec kick‑off meeting with sponsor.
- Data & security intake (access accounts / datasets).
- Stakeholder RACI document.
- Project schedule + demo dates.
- Co‑creation workspace set up (confluence, slack channel).
Contractual elements
- IP & ownership default: prototypes owned by client; jointly filed patents recommended; have add‑ons for exclusive IP handling.
- Data protection: DPA & security checklist mandatory for enterprise clients.

7) Growth Levers — automation, productization path, team expansion plan
Automation opportunities
- Automated proposal & pricing generator (templates via CRM).
- AI‑assisted prototyping framework (reusable pipelines, model templates, LLM prompt library).
- Codebase of reusable components & microservices (accelerates prototype time).
- Automated performance dashboards for validation and client reporting.
Productization path (3 tiers)
- Packaged Sprint (entry product): 2‑week ideation or 6‑week prototype — fixed price £25k–£50k.
- Quarterly AIP Subscription (core product): 4×90‑day cycles per year with priority access, retainer + success fee.
- Enterprise Innovation Suite (scalable): bespoke long‑term programme + productionisation & managed services.
Monetisation levers
- Premium for IP acceleration (patent filing assistance).
- Managed productionisation retainers (post‑prototype build).
- Platform licensing of proprietary prompt stacks / model assets.
Team expansion plan (18–36 months example)
- Year 1 hires: 4 delivery hires, 1 AE, 1 SDR, 1 Demand lead, 1 Marketing Ops.
- Year 2 hires: scale to 3 pods total, 3 AEs, 3 SDRs, 1 Partnerships lead, 1 Head of Productisation.
- Year 3 hires: build to 8 pods, 8–10 AEs/SDRs, engineering team for production services, legal/IP advisor, training/academy lead.
Hiring timeline tied to revenue milestones to avoid overhire:
- Trigger hire rule: hire when pipeline coverage > 3× required bookings for next 90 days.
- Ramp KPIs: new hires target utilisation in month 4; full productivity by month 6.

8) Capacity Constraints, Risk Mitigation & Milestones
Capacity constraints
- Talent availability: senior ML engineers and delivery leads are scarce; use contractors/regional hires to bridge.
- Data & legal: prolonged data access or procurement cycles can delay start (mitigation: pre‑sales data readiness assessment).
- Partner dependency: co‑sell timelines from cloud partners can be slow — maintain direct sales capability.
Risk mitigation
- Keep small fixed‑price discovery sprints to de‑risk sourcing and procurement friction.
- Maintain bench of trusted contractors and nearshore partners for immediate scale.
- Use standardised security & legal templates to speed contracting.
Growth milestones (example timeline & metrics)
- Month 0–3: SOPs live, 4 case studies, ABM pilot started.
- Month 6: 3 delivery pods ready, MQL→SQL conversion baseline; revenue 2× baseline.
- Month 12: Productised sprint launched; partner agreements signed with 2 cloud vendors; revenue 3–4× baseline.
