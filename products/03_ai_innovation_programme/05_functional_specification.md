# AI Innovation Programme • Functional Specification

Overview
- The AI Innovation Programme is a quarterly-focused service that converts R&D spend into a predictable pipeline of validated, patent‑worthy AI products and features. Using Brilliant Noise’s Test‑Learn‑Lead™ methodology, we help CMOs, CDOs and Innovation Directors generate breakthrough concepts, validate them rapidly, and embed capability so clients ship AI‑enabled value 4x faster than traditional R&D cycles.

Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Executive sponsorship and decision‑gate owners (CDO/CMO/Head of Innovation).
- Committed innovation budget (programme from £25,000; scope-dependent).
- Cross‑functional core team (product, engineering/R&D, legal/IP, business owner, data steward), 1–3 day/week availability during sprints.
- Access to domain data, product backlog, and relevant customer insight.
- Existing technology/R&D landscape overview and compliance/regulatory constraints.
- Clear target outcomes (e.g., revenue uplift, cost reduction, customer engagement, IP goals).

Core Process (step-by-step)
1. Align & Scope (Week 0–1)
   - Define business objectives, success metrics, risk appetite and governance.
   - Map existing R&D pipelines and integration touchpoints.

2. Opportunity Framing (Week 1–2)
   - Prioritise problem spaces using impact-feasibility filters and commercial criteria.
   - Agree target use cases and success thresholds.

3. AI‑powered Ideation (Workshop series, Week 2)
   - Facilitate cross‑functional workshops to generate breakthrough concepts anchored in commercial opportunities.
   - Surface patentable ideas and customer value propositions.

4. Prioritisation & Roadmap (End Week 2)
   - Rank concepts via business case, go‑to‑market potential, technical dependency and IP potential.
   - Select quarterly backlog of prototypes with decision gates.

5. Rapid Prototyping & Validation (Weeks 3–12 per sprint)
   - Build focused prototypes/MVPs to test core hypotheses against defined metrics.
   - Run controlled experiments, gather metrics and user feedback.

6. Learn & Decide (End of sprint)
   - Evaluate prototypes against success criteria; decide pivot, scale or retire.
   - Document IP opportunities and prepare handover for productisation.

7. Capability Transfer & Scaling (Ongoing)
   - Train client teams, embed playbooks and set quarterly cadence for subsequent cycles.

Outputs & Deliverables
- Customised Test‑Learn‑Lead™ innovation roadmap and governance model.
- Quarterly pipeline of prioritised AI concepts (with business cases).
- 1–3 validated prototypes/MVPs per quarter (functional demos, experiment results).
- IP assessment and recommendations (patentable claims, filings support).
- Playbooks, training sessions and role‑based upskilling for client teams.
- Handover pack for integration into product/R&D with prioritised next steps.

Success Criteria (how we measure)
- Velocity: average time‑to‑validated prototype reduced (target 4x faster).
- Throughput: number of validated concepts per quarter (target ≥2–3).
- Commercial impact: measurable KPIs per prototype (revenue, cost savings, engagement uplift).
- Conversion: % prototypes moved to productisation within 6 months.
- IP outcomes: number of patentable claims filed or substantiated.
- Adoption: stakeholder satisfaction, capability retention and internal NPS post‑handover.

Constraints & Limitations
- Outcomes depend on client data access, organisational decision speed and committed budget.
- Not a long‑term systems integration or enterprise implementation service — handover required for scaling.
- Regulatory, privacy and industry compliance can limit certain use cases.
- Intellectual property assignment and confidentiality terms must be agreed up‑front.
- Results are probabilistic; not every experiment yields a commercial breakthrough.
