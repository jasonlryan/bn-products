# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Functional Specification

1) Overview (what it does)
- A 5‑day consultancy sprint that uses AI-driven multi‑source analysis plus expert interpretation to deliver campaign‑ready consumer and competitive insights for fast‑moving markets.  
- Purpose: replace slow, expensive research cycles with a rapid, actionable insight package that reduces time‑to‑decision and risk when launching campaigns or product moves.  
- Price point: £10,000 (positioned vs. £30k+ traditional studies).

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Business objective and primary decision(s) to be resolved (campaign brief, target KPI, launch window).  
- Target audience definitions and priority markets/channels.  
- Access to owned analytics (web, CRM, ad accounts) or export data files.  
- Competitor list and known market signals.  
- Any recent research, brand trackers or creative assets.  
- One executive sponsor and 2–4 stakeholder participants available for kickoff and final review sessions.  
- Legal/permissions checklist for any third‑party data use.

3) Core Process (step-by-step)
- Day 0 (Pre‑Sprint): Brief alignment, success metrics confirmed, data access set up, roles assigned.  
- Day 1 — Rapid Discovery & Hypotheses: Clarify decisions, map audiences, generate prioritized hypotheses.  
- Day 2 — Multi‑Source Signal Capture: Aggregate signals from social, search, owned analytics, competitive behavior and available panels; surface behavioural patterns and anomalies.  
- Day 3 — Insight Synthesis & Validation: AI-assisted synthesis produces candidate insights; experts validate, triangulate and surface consumer tension points and opportunity spaces.  
- Day 4 — Prioritisation & Strategy: Score opportunities by impact, feasibility, timing and cost; outline campaign concepts, positioning, and measurement approach.  
- Day 5 — Delivery & Next Steps: Present prioritized insights, recommended strategy and a 30/90‑day activation roadmap; agree immediate experiments and handover items.  
- Follow‑up: Optional quick‑win experiment support or dashboard setup (out of scope for core sprint but scoped at handover).

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Executive summary: top 3–5 prioritized insights and opportunity statements.  
- Strategic recommendations: positioning, campaign concepts, audience targeting, and channel sequencing.  
- Competitive intelligence: blind spots, competitor moves and white‑space mapping.  
- Measurement framework: KPIs, success thresholds, suggested experiments.  
- Deliverables pack: slide deck, one‑page brief for creative, CSVs of underlying signals, and a simple monitoring dashboard template.  
- Handover checklist for activation.

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Timeliness: deliverables produced within the 5‑day sprint window.  
- Actionability: at least one campaign or experiment is scoped and ready to launch within 14 days.  
- Stakeholder confidence: average stakeholder satisfaction ≥8/10 on usefulness and clarity.  
- Quality: insights triangulated across ≥2 independent data sources.  
- Value: demonstrable cost/time saving vs. traditional research (target ≥66% cost reduction and 80% faster).  
- Business impact (post‑engagement): adoption rate of recommendations and early KPI movement on signed experiments (tracked in follow‑up).

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Dependent on timely client participation and data access—delays reduce output quality.  
- Not a substitute for large‑scale longitudinal studies or regulated research requiring random probability sampling.  
- Quality limited by available data scope and representativeness; niche or low‑volume audiences may require additional fieldwork.  
- AI accelerates synthesis but outputs require human expert validation; results are directional and prioritised, not definitive causal proof.  
- Regulatory, privacy or contractual limits on third‑party data may restrict some analyses.
