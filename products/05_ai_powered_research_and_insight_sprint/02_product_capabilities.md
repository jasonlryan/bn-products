# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Product Capabilities

AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint — Sales Enablement Brief

Purpose: one-page usable by sales to explain the core capabilities, business benefits, how it’s delivered, where it plugs into customer tech/processes, and how the offering will grow over the next 6 months.

1) Primary Capabilities (4) — what we do and the business benefit
1. Rapid Evidence Generation (5‑day sprint)
   - What: Produce robust, campaign-ready insights in five days instead of the typical 5+ weeks.
   - Business benefit: Speed to market — launch campaigns weeks earlier, reduce time-to-revenue, and avoid costly delays or missed seasonal windows. Typical research cost and timeline cut by ~80% (price point: £10k vs £30k+).

2. Competitive Blindspot & Opportunity Identification
   - What: AI-led synthesis across social, search, transaction and first‑party signals to reveal competitor weaknesses and invisible opportunities.
   - Business benefit: First-mover advantage — target underserved segments or messaging gaps competitors miss, improving campaign relevance and conversion potential.

3. Actionable, Consumer‑Backed Campaign Blueprints
   - What: Clear hypotheses, prioritized audiences, creative hooks, messaging frameworks and measurement ladders validated by data.
   - Business benefit: Higher campaign hit-rate and lower creative waste — campaigns start with evidence-backed bets that drive better CTRs, engagement and ROI.

4. Continuous Monitoring + Prioritised Opportunity Dashboard
   - What: Compact dashboards and a short playbook for ongoing tracking and immediate tactics if market conditions change.
   - Business benefit: Faster iteration and risk reduction — real-time monitoring lets teams reallocate budget or creative quickly to capitalize on trends or stem underperformance.

2) Delivery Method — how it works in practice (client-facing process)
Day 0 — Kickoff (1 hour)
   - Align objectives, success metrics, datasets and approvals. Confirm 1–2 campaign questions or product hypotheses.
Days 1–3 — Data synthesis & AI analysis
   - We ingest agreed data slices (social, search trends, first‑party signals, competitive mentions) and run rapid AI synthesis to surface patterns and hypotheses.
Day 4 — Expert interpretation & prioritisation workshop (2 hours)
   - Senior strategists convert AI outputs into ranked opportunities, messaging options and measurement plans using our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ lens.
Day 5 — Delivery & handover
   - Deliverables: short insight deck (top 5 opportunities), creative & media briefs, prioritized test plan, competitive intelligence summary, and a lightweight dashboard for monitoring.
Handover & next steps
   - 1 follow-up session in week 2 to track early signals and agree immediate iterations or full-scale roll-out.

Client time commitment: ~4–6 hours across the week. Outcome: actionable launch-ready plan and monitoring tools within five business days.

3) Integration Points — where this fits into existing tools & processes
   - MarTech & Campaign Planning: Feeds into campaign briefs and media plans (Adobe, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, HubSpot). Business outcome: directly reduce planning friction and accelerate procurement/activation.
   - Analytics & BI: Exports to GA4, Looker, Power BI dashboards or client BI for measurement alignment. Business outcome: single source of truth for pre/post-campaign performance and faster validation.
   - Social & Listening Platforms: Integrates outputs with Meta, X/Twitter, TikTok, Brandwatch reports so social teams can act on creative hooks and trending themes. Business outcome: faster social activation and trend exploitation.
   - Commerce & Transaction Systems: Incorporates e‑commerce performance signals to prioritise high‑value opportunities. Business outcome: better targeting of profitable segments and lower CAC.
   - Internal Processes: Designed to plug into campaign gating, sprint planning, and weekly marketing standups for fast decisioning. Business outcome: removes research as a gating item and accelerates sprints.
   - Governance & Procurement: Fixed-scope, £10k sprint model is designed to simplify approvals vs large research contracts. Business outcome: quicker procurement sign-off and predictable spend.

4) Capability Roadmap — Today vs 6‑month vision (business outcomes-focused)
Today (what you’re buying now)
   - 5‑day sprint delivering prioritized insights, creative briefs, competitive intelligence and a lightweight monitoring dashboard.
   - Senior strategist-led interpretation so outputs are immediately actionable.
   - Integrations via simple exports and manual handoffs to client systems.
   - Outcome focus: fast, low-cost validation and campaign-ready hypotheses that reduce launch risk.

6‑month vision (what enables bigger business outcomes)
   - Real‑time connectors to major MarTech and social platforms for near-instant data refresh and auto‑alerts — outcome: continuous intel that shortens iteration loops.
   - Industry-specific sprint templates (FMCG, retail, CPG, automotive, tech) to further speed up insight generation and increase relevance — outcome: higher-quality, sector-tailored insights and faster adoption.
   - Experiment activation playbooks that move straight from insight to A/B test setups and measurement plans — outcome: shorter test cycles and clearer attribution of impact.
   - ROI/outcome module linking sprint recommendations to expected KPI impacts (CAC, conversion, LTV) and post-launch performance tracking — outcome: clearer business case and ability to quantify uplift vs cost.
   - Scaled delivery options: single sprint, sprint + monitoring subscription, or sprint-to-rollout program (retainer) — outcome: flexible commercial models that support both one-off needs and ongoing optimisation.

Positioning talking points for sales
   - “Campaign-winning insights in 5 days, not 5 weeks — at a third of the cost of traditional research.”
   - “Designed for CMOs and marketing teams who must move fast: validated creative hooks, prioritized audiences and a measurement plan you can act on immediately.”
   - “We combine AI speed with senior strategist judgement — so you get rigorous evidence and commercial recommendations in the same week.”
   - “Easy procurement and low client time commitment — quick approval, rapid output, measurable outcomes.”

Use this brief to:
   - Lead discovery conversations by asking which upcoming launches would benefit from a 5‑day market reality check.
   - Position the sprint as a risk‑reduction, speed-to-market play that complements existing research or replaces expensive long-lead studies.
   - Close smaller deals quickly while opening a pathway to broader transformation engagements (Test‑Learn‑Lead™ operating model).
