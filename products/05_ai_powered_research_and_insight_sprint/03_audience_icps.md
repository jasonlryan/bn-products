# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Audience Icps

Below are four Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) tailored for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint. Each profile follows the exact requested sections and includes specific metrics, timeframes, and quantified outcomes where possible.

---

## ICP 1 — Global CMO (FMCG / CPG / Global Brand)

**Profile**  
- Role: Chief Marketing Officer (or Global Head of Brand/Marketing)  
- Company size: 10,000+ employees, revenue > £1B  
- Industry: FMCG / CPG / Global consumer brands (e.g., food & drink, apparel, household)  

**Motivations**  
- Protect and grow market share in highly competitive global markets.  
- Speed up go-to-market for seasonal or regional campaigns.  
- De-risk multi-million pound media investments with robust consumer evidence.  
- Demonstrate short-term campaign lift and longer-term brand strategy alignment to the board.  
- Values: responsible/ethical partners (B-Corp alignment is a differentiator).  

**Pain Points**  
- Traditional research cycles (4–6 weeks, £30k+) are too slow and expensive for rapid seasonal windows.  
- Siloed insight sources (agency-owned, internal analytics, syndicated panels) that don’t reconcile quickly.  
- Late pivots after creative or media are committed — costly rework of £100k+ per regional campaign.  
- Difficulty demonstrating measurable ROI to Finance and the Board within a quarter.  

**Success Looks Like**  
- Deliver validated campaign insight in 5 days and launch campaign within 2 weeks (vs current 6+ weeks).  
- Reduce pre-launch uncertainty such that media spend efficiency improves by 15% within the first 3 months.  
- Identify 2–3 unique positioning opportunities or creative hooks that lift expected CTR by 10–20%.  
- Prevent at least one major campaign pivot that would have cost >£50k.  
- Executive reporting: present sprint outputs to the executive committee within 10 business days.  

**Budget Authority**  
- Purchasing dynamics: CMO sets strategy, but procurement/legal often involved for vendor contracting.  
- Typical pilot budget approval: £10k–£50k within marketing/innovation experimentation budget.  
- Approval lead time: 2–4 weeks for full procurement; immediate sign-off possible for smaller test budgets under £15k.  

**Buying Process**  
- Trigger: seasonal calendar, major product launch, or major competitor move.  
- Evaluation criteria: speed (5-day deliverable), proven quality (case studies with global brands), data security & privacy, commercial terms.  
- Stakeholders: CMO, Global Brand Director, Head of Insights, Procurement, Legal (for master services agreement).  
- Typical steps: initial briefing → 1–2 hour sprint scoping call → procurement review (if needed) → 5-day sprint pilot → executive readout → decision to scale.  
- Timeline: 3–6 weeks from first contact to signed agreement for enterprise procurement contexts.

**Motivations**  
- Maximise short-term ROAS and lower CAC during promotional periods.  
- Rapidly iterate creative and messaging across channels (social, paid search, email).  
- Stretch limited budgets with high-confidence decisions; prove incremental value quickly.  

**Pain Points**  
- Small teams juggling insight requests and execution; limited in-house research capability.  
- Waiting 4–6 weeks for research means missing real-time trends and losing acquisition windows.  
- Wasted ad spend on poorly validated creative/messages (often 10–30% of budget wasted).

**Success Looks Like**  
- Cut insight turnaround from 4 weeks to 5 days to enable 1–2 sprinted campaign launches per month.

- Validate 3 high-conviction channel/messaging hypotheses that can be A/B tested within 2 weeks.  

**Budget Authority**  
- Decision-maker: Head of Marketing/Growth can approve pilots up to ~£25k.  
- Approval lead time: 48 hours – 7 days (often immediate for credit-card purchases or via PO).  
- Contracting: minimal procurement friction; short SOW accepted.  

**Buying Process**  
- Trigger: need to rescue underperforming campaign, upcoming promo window, or new product drop.  
- Evaluation criteria: speed, cost-effectiveness vs traditional research, case studies for e-comm brands, pragmatic activation recommendations.  
- Stakeholders: Head of Marketing, Performance Marketing Manager, CEO/Founder (for smaller DTC brands).  
- Steps: demo & short scoping call → 5-day sprint (paid) → immediate campaign playbook delivered → quick measurement & iterate.

- Industry: Technology hardware, consumer electronics, connected devices, fast-moving tech-enabled consumer products  

**Motivations**  
- Spot emergent consumer needs and nascent trends to inform roadmap and product-market fit decisions.  
- Reduce time and cost of early-stage validation to avoid building the wrong features.  
- Translate consumer insight directly into product hypotheses and prioritized roadmaps.  

**Pain Points**  
- Long validation loops between ideation and consumer feedback (3–6 months).  
- Too much internal debate without data to prioritise features — leads to bloated backlogs and delayed launches.  
- Difficulty quantifying commercial potential of new features quickly enough for investment decisions.  

**Success Looks Like**  
- Generate prioritized insight in 5 days that identifies top 2 unmet consumer needs and 1–2 product concepts with high commercial potential.  
- Reduce product validation cycle time by ~60% (e.g., cut from 12 weeks to 5 weeks for initial decision-making).  
- Deliver evidence that supports a go/no-go decision and a 6–12 month roadmap with estimated user impact (e.g., potential revenue uplift of X% or 100k incremental users).  
- Secure cross-functional buy-in (Product, Engineering, Commercial) for MVP development within 30 days of sprint completion.  

**Budget Authority**  
- Innovation budgets typically held by the Innovation Director or CPO; pilots approved in the range £10k–£75k.  
- Purchases >£25k may require CFO or CPO sign-off and brief procurement; standard pilot at £10k usually fast-tracked.  
- Approval lead time: 1–3 weeks for formal sign-off; immediate for internal experimentation funds.  

**Buying Process**  
- Trigger: new opportunity scan, strategy offsite, investor deadlines, or backlogs indicating uncertainty.  
- Evaluation criteria: ability to surface trend signals from disparate datasets, quality of strategic recommendations, integration with product discovery processes.  
- Stakeholders: Innovation Director, Product Strategy, Research/UX, CFO (for larger spend).  
- Steps: discovery workshop → tailored sprint scope (align to product questions) → 5-day sprint → prioritised product hypotheses + roadmap → decision meeting.  
- Timeline: 2–5 weeks from scoping to executive decision to build.

**Pain Points**  
- Lack of robust consumer or market signals to prioritise channels and messaging.

- Approval speed: 24–72 hours (very fast).  
- Contracts: usually a short SOW; procurement/legal involvement minimal.  

**Buying Process**  
- Trigger: impending fundraising milestone, need to scale a new channel, or poor cohort conversion.
