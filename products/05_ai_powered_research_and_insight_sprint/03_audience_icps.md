### Pain Points
- Research cycles that take 4–8+ weeks, delaying campaign launches and missing seasonal peaks.  
- High traditional research costs (£30k+) with long turnaround and unclear commercial ROI.  
- Siloed first‑party and third‑party data, making fast, holistic insight generation difficult.  
- Risk of launching campaigns without validated consumer backing → wasted media and creative spend.

- Typical budget range for pilot/innovation work: £10k–£250k annually for strategic testing and capability building.

### Buying Process
- Evaluation timeframe: 4–8 weeks for enterprise procurement & legal review.  
- Typical steps: scoping call with Brilliant Noise → internal stakeholder demo (Brand + Market Insights + Legal/Procurement) → pilot approval (5-day Sprint) → evaluation against agreed KPIs → scale decision.
