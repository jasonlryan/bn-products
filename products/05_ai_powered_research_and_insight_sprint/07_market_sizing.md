# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Market Sizing

Below is a structured TAM (Total Addressable Market) estimate for Brilliant Noise’s AI‑Powered Research and Insight Sprint using both Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up approaches, with formulas, explicit assumptions (and ranges), a sensitivity table (±20% on key assumptions), and three go‑to‑market implications.

Key definitions
- TAM = total global spend that could be addressed by this product category.
- SAM = portion of TAM that is serviceable given Brilliant Noise’s target segments / geographies / use cases.
- SOM = share of SAM Brilliant Noise can realistically capture in the near/medium term (3 years).

ASSUMPTIONS / SOURCES
- Global Market Research industry size: ESOMAR / industry sources estimate ~$80–90B per year (I use $84B as a central figure). Convert USD→GBP at 1 USD = 0.80 GBP (rounded). Source: ESOMAR industry reports (public industry summary; use as benchmark). Where public datapoints are not exact I state best‑guess logic.
- Product price: £10,000 per sprint (given).
- Typical buyers: CMOs / marketing teams at enterprise & mid‑market brands, plus agencies buying on behalf of clients.
- “Campaign / rapid research” share of market research spend and “addressable by AI rapid sprints” are judgment calls — I state ranges and show sensitivity.

TOP‑DOWN METHOD
Goal: start from total market research spend and estimate the fraction relevant to rapid, campaign‑facing, AI‑enabled short sprints.

Inputs / formula
- Global MR market (USD) = $84B → convert to GBP:
  - MR_GBP = $84B * 0.80 = £67.2B
- Let A = share of MR spent on campaign/marketing/advertising research (assumption).
  - Base A = 30% (range 20%–40%).
- Let B = share of that campaign research addressable / replaceable by AI rapid sprints (assumption).
  - Base B = 30% (range 20%–40%).

TAM_topdown = MR_GBP * A * B

Calculation (base)
- TAM_topdown = £67.2B * 0.30 * 0.30 = £6.05B

Top‑down sensitivity (A and B each ±20%)
- Low (A=24%, B=24%): TAM = 67.2 * 0.24 * 0.24 = £3.87B
- Base (A=30%, B=30%): TAM = £6.05B
- High (A=36%, B=36%): TAM = 67.2 * 0.36 * 0.36 = £8.71B

Notes on assumptions:
- A captures advertising/campaign research, agile consumer insight, social listening, short panels, and ad testing. This is typically a meaningful slice of MR spend but not all research (which includes long‑term product R&D, syndicated studies, compliance research, etc.).
- B captures the share that can realistically be delivered by a 5‑day AI‑driven sprint vs. traditional long studies.

BOTTOM‑UP METHOD
Goal: estimate demand based on number of target organisations, adoption rate, purchase frequency and price.

Segmented approach with explicit counts & rates (all counts are estimates / best‑guess):
Segments and assumptions
1) Large enterprise brands (global revenue > £1B)
   - Estimated companies globally: 20,000 (estimate; includes global brands in FMCG, Auto, Retail, Tech).
   - % that will adopt sprint offering (within addressable period): 50% → 10,000 customers.
   - Avg sprints per adopting customer per year: 4 (quarterly campaign cadence).
   - Revenue per sprint: £10,000
   - Revenue_Enterprise = 10,000 * 4 * 10,000 = £400M

2) Mid‑market brands (£50M–£1B revenue)
   - Estimated companies: 130,000 (estimate).
   - Adoption%: 20% → 26,000 customers.
   - Avg sprints / year: 2
   - Revenue_Mid = 26,000 * 2 * 10,000 = £520M

3) Agencies & consultancies buying for clients
   - Estimated agencies globally that commission research: 50,000
   - Adoption%: 40% → 20,000 agency buyers
   - Avg sprints / year per agency: 1.25
   - Revenue_Agencies = 20,000 * 1.25 * 10,000 = £250M

4) SMBs / Startups & other small buyers
   - Pool considered: 100,000
   - Adoption%: 5% → 5,000 buyers
   - Avg sprints / year: 1
   - Revenue_SMB = 5,000 * 1 * 10,000 = £50M

Bottom‑up base total (sum of above)
- TAM_bottomup (practical addressable with the product features) = £400M + £520M + £250M + £50M = £1.22B

Possible expansion (SaaS/productised versions, repeatable templates, marketplace/white‑label partners)
- Add upside for productised/scaled delivery (platform + partners) = + ~£300M (conservative), giving an upper bottom‑up of ~£1.52B.

Bottom‑up sensitivity (±20% on adoption / counts / frequency)
- Low ~£1.0B; Base ~£1.2–1.5B; High ~£1.8B

RECONCILING TOP‑DOWN & BOTTOM‑UP
- Top‑down (what portion of overall MR spend could be displaced): £3.9B – £8.7B (central £6.0B).
- Bottom‑up (practical revenue reachable given buyer counts and reasonable adoption): ~£1.0–1.8B (central ~£1.2–1.5B).
- Good practice: use top‑down to size the broader opportunity and bottom‑up for realistic near‑term revenue potential. They should inform SAM and SOM.

Recommended TAM / SAM / SOM (final numbers — pick values that align with both methods)
- TAM (addressable global market for AI rapid campaign research sprints) — use Top‑Down central: £6.0B (range £3.9B–£8.7B).
- SAM (Brilliant Noise serviceable market = focus on English‑language / Western / enterprise & mid‑market brands + agency channel) — take ~30% of TAM: SAM = £1.8B (range ~£1.2B–£2.2B). This aligns with bottom‑up central (~£1.2–1.5B) and acknowledges geographical/serviceability limits.
- SOM (realistic share Brilliant Noise could capture in 3 years)
  - Conservative: 0.5% of SAM = £9M / year
  - Base (achievable target): 1.0% of SAM = £18M / year
  - Ambitious: 3.0% of SAM = £54M / year

SOM context: at £10k per sprint, 1% SOM (= £18M) = 1,800 sprints/year ≈ 150 sprints/month. That is ambitious but plausible with a scaled delivery model and partnerships; 0.5% (= £9M) = 75 sprints/month.

SENSITIVITY TABLE (±20% on key assumptions)
Key assumptions varied: A (campaign share), B (addressable by sprints), Target counts/adoption (bottom‑up), price.
We show three scenarios: Conservative (−20%), Base, Aggressive (+20%).

1) Top‑Down TAM (formula: MR_GBP * A * B; MR_GBP fixed at £67.2B)
- Conservative (A=24%, B=24%): TAM ≈ £3.87B → SAM (30%) ≈ £1.16B
- Base (A=30%, B=30%): TAM ≈ £6.05B → SAM ≈ £1.82B
- Aggressive (A=36%, B=36%): TAM ≈ £8.71B → SAM ≈ £2.61B

2) Bottom‑Up practical revenue (sum of segments; key inputs ±20%)
- Conservative (~−20% on counts / adoption / frequency): ≈ £1.0B
- Base: ≈ £1.22–1.52B
- Aggressive (+20%): ≈ £1.8B

3) SOM scenarios (expressed as % of SAM)
- If SAM = £1.16B (conservative), SOM 1% = £11.6M; SOM 3% = £34.8M
- If SAM = £1.82B (base), SOM 1% = £18.2M; SOM 3% = £54.6M
- If SAM = £2.61B (aggressive), SOM 1% = £26.1M; SOM 3% = £78.3M

(These tables above translate ±20% on A/B and ±20% on bottom‑up inputs into TAM/SAM/SOM bands.)

Three clear go‑to‑market implications (actionable)
1) Prioritise enterprise & agency channel first (highest ARR / fastest route to volume)
   - Rationale: enterprise and global agency buyers have bigger budgets, higher sprint frequency (campaign cadence), and prestige case studies that accelerate trust (and they were the highest contributors in the bottom‑up model).
   - Action: build tailored enterprise packages (quarterly program deals), an agency partner program and co‑sell incentives.

2) Productise price / delivery to scale (to move from boutique to repeatable revenue)
   - Rationale: to capture 1%+ SOM requires repeatable delivery at ~100+ sprints/month; that requires playbooks, automation, templates, and modular SLAs.
   - Action: create 3 standard packages (pilot 5‑day sprint, 3‑month insight program, enterprise subscription), invest in tooling/ops, define clear ROI metrics vs. £30k legacy studies.

3) Invest in proof points that show time/price ROI and sector case studies
   - Rationale: Buyers trade off accuracy vs. speed/cost. Sell the value: “£10k / 5 days vs £30k / 5+ weeks” with outcome metrics (time to campaign launch, uplift in CTR/conversion from insight‑driven creative).
   - Action: publish 6–8 rapid case studies (FMCG, tech, auto) with quantified outcomes and a calculator that shows payback for CMOs. Use these as conversion assets for enterprise and agency outreach.

Final recommended focus for Brilliant Noise
- Treat TAM (~£6B) as the long‑term prize; focus initial SAM (~£1.8B) in English‑language enterprise/mid‑market + agency channels; set a 3‑year SOM target in the £9–54M band (start with a 0.5–1% goal; scale to 3% with productised delivery + partnerships).
- Track three metrics to manage toward SOM: number of enterprise program wins, average sprints/customer/year, and gross margin per sprint (to determine scalable capacity).

If you want, I can:
- Convert all numbers into USD or EUR.
- Produce a 3‑year revenue ramp showing hires/operational capacity required to reach each SOM scenario.
- Break the bottom‑up by industry (FMCG, Auto, Finance, Tech) so you can prioritise ICPs.
