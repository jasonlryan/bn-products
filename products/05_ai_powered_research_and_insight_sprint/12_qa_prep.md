# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Qa Prep

1) Question: What’s the size and growth opportunity for a 5‑day AI research sprint in the market?
Answer: The sprint sits at the intersection of multi‑billion pound marketing research and martech budgets, addressing a growing demand from CMOs for faster, cheaper, insight-driven campaign decisions; adoption is accelerating as teams prioritise speed and data-backed creativity.  
Follow-up: I can share our TAM estimate, segment assumptions and a slide with market sources on request.

2) Question: What is your core moat vs consultancies, ad agencies and pure‑tech vendors?
Answer: Our moat is a blended capability: proprietary AI synthesis pipelines plus senior marketing transformation expertise and validated playbooks that turn raw signals into campaign-ready strategy faster than pure‑tech or classic agencies.  
Follow-up: Want a competitor matrix showing exactly how our capabilities and pricing compare?

3) Question: How do you price and package the product, and what’s the upsell path?
Answer: We sell the core 5‑day sprint at £10,000 as a low‑friction entry product, with follow‑on upsells to retainered insight services, ongoing dashboards, and transformation engagements that deliver higher lifetime value.  
Follow-up: I can send our pricing tiers and typical customer journey from sprint to retainer.

4) Question: What do unit economics look like (margins, CAC payback, LTV drivers)?
Answer: Unit economics are strong due to high gross margins from reusable AI tooling and expert time leveraged across multiple clients; customer LTV is driven by upsells to ongoing analytics, strategy retainers and creative execution.  
Follow-up: We can provide anonymised cohort metrics (CAC, LTV, margin and payback) under NDA.

5) Question: How scalable is the model as you try to grow beyond current clients?
Answer: The model scales via automation of data ingestion and synthesis, standardised deliverable templates, and a trainable expert network, with human QC preserved to protect quality as volume increases.  
Follow-up: Ask for our operational playbook that maps headcount, tool costs and throughput by scale.

6) Question: How do you validate quality and avoid AI hallucinations or bad insights?
Answer: Every AI‑synthesised output undergoes human expert validation using source traceability, triangulation across datasets and rapid client feedback loops to ensure actionable, evidence‑backed recommendations.  
Follow-up: I can share a sample sprint report showing source provenance and our QC checklist.

7) Question: Who are your main competitors and how do you defend against them?
Answer: Competitors include large consultancies (speed and price mismatch), specialist research firms (slower/expensive) and analytics platforms (lack human strategy); we defend by combining rapid AI synthesis with senior marketing expertise and proven campaign outcomes.  
Follow-up: Want a one‑page competitor comparison with real client win/loss examples?

8) Question: What are the biggest business risks and how are you mitigating them?
Answer: Key risks are client scepticism of AI output, data access limits, and talent scale; we mitigate via low‑commitment pilots, strong data governance, repeatable training for consultants and client case studies demonstrating ROI.  
Follow-up: I can send risk‑mitigation case studies and our pilot conversion metrics.

9) Question: How strong is the team to execute and scale — do you have the right hires in place?
Answer: Founders and leadership combine 15+ years in digital transformation, AI productisation and enterprise marketing, supported by an experienced delivery team and a hiring roadmap focused on senior strategists and data engineers.  
Follow-up: I can share bios, org chart and our recruiting pipeline for the next 12 months.

10) Question: How defensible is your IP and data pipeline?
Answer: Defensibility comes from bespoke data connectors, proprietary synthesis templates, closed‑loop playbooks and client relationships rather than a single patentable asset, creating high switching costs for enterprise customers.  
Follow-up: Ask for a tech architecture diagram and list of proprietary components we control.

11) Question: How do you handle data privacy, GDPR and client confidentiality?
Answer: We operate under strict DPA controls, use only permitted public and client‑owned data, pseudonymise personally identifiable information where required, and embed contractual protections and security audits into all engagements.  
Follow-up: I can provide our standard DPA, security summary and SOC‑type checklist.

12) Question: What liability or regulatory risks arise from using AI for insights, and who bears responsibility for decisions?
Answer: We minimise regulatory and liability exposure by delivering source‑attributed, human‑validated recommendations, clear client acceptance points and contractual language allocating decision responsibility to the client for campaign choices.  
Follow-up: I can share our standard contractual clauses and a legal memo on AI output liability.
