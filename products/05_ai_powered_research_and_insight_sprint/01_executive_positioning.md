# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Marketing and strategy teams in fast-moving markets are forced to choose between slow, expensive research (5+ weeks, Â£30k+) or launching campaigns with weak evidence. That delay and cost leave teams exposed to competitor blind spots and costly creative missteps.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- Use AI-driven analysis across social, search, transaction and first-party data to surface campaign-driving insights in 5 days.  
- Combine machine-speed pattern detection with senior strategist interpretation to turn data into a campaign-ready brief and strategic recommendations.  
- Deliver competitive intelligence that isolates market blind spots competitors miss and identifies defensible positioning.  
- Provide custom dashboards and templated reports for immediate monitoring and iterative Testâ€‘Learnâ€‘Leadâ„¢ follow-up.  
- Price at Â£10,000 to democratise rapid, high-quality researchâ€”delivering ~80% faster insight delivery than traditional approaches.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
On Day 3 the sprint reveals a specific unmet consumer need and clear competitor complacency, and the marketing team signs off the campaign that afternoon with a concrete creative direction backed by numbers.
