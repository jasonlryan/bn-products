# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Marketing and strategy teams in fast-moving categories are forced to launch campaigns on gut or slow, expensive research cycles â€” costing time, budget, and competitive advantage. Traditional studies take 4â€“6 weeks and Â£30k+, leaving teams exposed to market blind spots and late pivots.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- Run a 5-day AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint that ingests multi-source data (social, search, panel, owned analytics) and produces campaign-ready insights for Â£10,000.  
- Use automated AI analysis to surface patterns and competitive blind spots, then apply senior human interpretation to turn those patterns into strategic recommendations.  
- Deliver a concise playbook: prioritized opportunities, audience framings, creative hypotheses, and measurable KPIs so campaign teams can act immediately.  
- Provide custom dashboards and competitive intelligence snapshots for ongoing monitoring and rapid follow-up learning within our Test-Learn-Leadâ„¢ framework.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
On day three, the sprint surfaces a specific unmet need and a quantified competitor weakness â€” and the campaign brief is rewritten around that insight before the week is out.

## Audience
- CMOs and Marketing Directors in fast-moving consumer categories (FMCG, retail, DTC, tech-enabled services)  
- Chief Digital Officers and Innovation Directors needing rapid, defensible direction for launches  
- Brand and campaign teams under time pressure to validate creative and target choices  
- Data-driven teams that require rigorous insight without weeks-long lead times  
- Agencies and in-house strategy teams looking to de-risk campaign investment

## Why We're Excited
We built this Sprint because global brands need high-quality, actionable insight at the speed of market change â€” not at the pace of legacy research firms. As a Brighton-based B-Corp with deep marketing transformation experience, we can combine practical AI tooling, senior marketing judgement, and our Test-Learn-Leadâ„¢ method to deliver research that is faster, cheaper, and directly operational for campaigns. At Â£10k and five days, teams get the same strategic rigor they expect from a Â£30k+ study but with the agility to iterate and win in-market â€” reducing waste and increasing creative confidence across launch cycles.

## Positioning Statement
AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint: campaign-winning, AI-driven market insight in 5 days for Â£10k â€” the fast, practical alternative to Â£30k+ traditional research for CMOs who must move now.
