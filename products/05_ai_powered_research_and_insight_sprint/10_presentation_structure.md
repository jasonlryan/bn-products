Part D — Visual & Demo Insertion Points (what to show, why, duration, tech tips)
Plan visuals before the meeting; pre‑load assets and test screen sharing.

Core visual spots
- Slide 5 (5‑day timeline): Graphic of Day 0–5 with outputs per day. Purpose: clarity of process. Duration: 30–60s.
- Slide 6 (Deliverables): Example insight card + dashboard thumbnail. Purpose: show tangible outputs. Duration: 60–90s.
- Slide 7 (Proof): One‑page case study with headline metrics & client logo strip. Purpose: social proof. Duration: 30–60s.
- Slide 8 (Demo): Live/recorded demo of dashboard + competitive map + one autogenerated campaign hypothesis. Purpose: visceral “this is real” moment. Duration: 5–8 min.
  - Demo script snippet: Hook (10s) → show heatmap (45s) → open insight card (60s) → show recommended creative direction & evidence (60s) → export to brief (30s).
  - Tech checklist: pre‑load demo account, anonymise any real customer data, have a recorded fallback.
- Slide 9 (Pricing): Simple table comparing Sprint vs traditional research (cost, time, outputs). Purpose: commercial clarity. Duration: 30–60s.
- Slide 10 (Next steps): Calendar graphic with proposed kickoff week and quick checklist. Purpose: reduce friction to commit. Duration: 20–30s.

Demo best practices
- Live demo length: 3–7 minutes. If prospect is risk‑averse or connection unreliable, use a high‑quality recorded demo.
- Focus: show outcome first (insight card), then click back to evidence (data that supports it).
- Allow 1–2 minutes at the end of demo for immediate reactions/questions.

Part E — Transition Phrases & Meeting Flow Guidance
Use these short transitions to keep pace and control the meeting.

Opening to problem: “Before we jump in, let me quickly set out the challenge most marketing teams face.”
Problem to solution: “So, what does a faster, cheaper, but still rigorous alternative look like?”
Solution to process: “Here’s how we actually deliver that in five days.”
Process to outputs: “These steps produce tangible outputs — here’s exactly what you get.”
Outputs to demo: “Instead of describing it, let me show you an actual output from a Sprint.”
Demo to price: “Given that value, here’s how we price and package the Sprint.”
Price to close: “If we’re aligned, here’s the simplest way to get started.”
Into a deep dive: “If you’d like more detail, we can go deeper on the technical/ROI/implementation side now.”
End to next steps: “Great — agreed next steps are... Shall I pencil in [date] for kick‑off?”

Part F — Objection Handling Cheat Sheet (short)
- “Is 5 days enough?” — “We focus on prioritized questions and use AI + human QC; depth over breadth for immediate campaign needs.”
- “How accurate is the AI?” — “We use ensemble NLP plus human validation and confidence scoring; we’ll show you examples.”
- “Security concerns?” — “We support anonymisation, GDPR compliance, SSO and client‑only workspaces.”
- “What if we need deeper study?” — “Sprint is a rapid proof; we can follow with a deeper study or integration depending on outcomes.”

Part G — Recommended Meeting Cadence & Follow‑ups
- After meeting (same day): Send one‑page recap, sample insight card, and 3 potential kickoff dates.
- If interested: schedule 30‑minute alignment call (to set scope) followed by Sprint kickoff within 7–14 days.
- If technical buy‑in needed: set 45‑minute technical session with BN head of data.
