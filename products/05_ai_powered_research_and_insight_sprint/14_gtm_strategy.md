# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint
Audience: Brilliant Noise leadership (product, growth, delivery), sales & marketing, operations
Objective: Turn the 5‑day Research & Insight Sprint into a predictable, scalable product line and grow revenue 10x while preserving quality, B‑Corp values and premium positioning.

Assumptions (state these before implementation)
- Price per sprint: £10,000 (fixed).
- Baseline capacity today (if unknown): assume 3 active Sprint teams delivering 1 sprint/week each = 12 sprints/month = £120k/month = £1.44m ARR. (I will show two scenarios: Conservative baseline and Acceleration.)
- A “Sprint Team” is a cross‑functional unit that owns delivery of one 5‑day sprint (detailed in Operational Model).
- Target: 10x revenue from baseline (Conservative example target = £14.4m ARR). Adjust proportions if your real baseline differs — swap numbers proportionally.

Playbook sections:
1) Channel Strategy (primary & secondary channels with rationale)
2) Scalability Roadmap (how to grow from current capacity to 10x revenue)
3) Operational Model (delivery process, quality control, resource requirements)
4) Partnership Framework (referral programs, strategic partnerships)
5) Marketing Engine (channel priorities, content strategy, lead generation)
6) Sales Process (qualification, conversion, onboarding)
7) Growth Levers (automation opportunities, productization path, team expansion plan)
Each section ends with specific action items and milestones, and capacity constraints called out.

1) Channel Strategy
Primary channels (highest ROI for target buyers: CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors)
- Direct / Account-Based Marketing & Sales (ABM): focused outreach to top target accounts. Rationale: large deals, high LTV, relationship selling matches Brilliant Noise positioning.
- Strategic Partnerships / Agency Alliances: embed Sprint as capability partners (e.g., branding agencies, media networks, digital consultancies). Rationale: leverages partner relationships, drives repeat bookings, clients see partner-provided credibility.
- Thought Leadership & Content (owned media, LinkedIn, CEO/Founder POV): position as rapid AI research experts. Rationale: targets CMOs & C-suite where trust signals and ideas matter.
- Events & Executive Roundtables (invite-only): short demos and case clinics. Rationale: high-touch channel for enterprise decision makers.

Secondary channels
- Performance Digital (LinkedIn Ads, intent-based search): for mid-market and corporate leads.
- Platform Integrations & Marketplaces (e.g., agency marketplaces, tech partner ecosystems): lower-touch, discoverability for smaller brands.
- Referral Programs (client & partner referrals, alumni networks): cost-effective growth.
- PR and Analyst briefings (select): to reinforce credibility vs. consultancies.

Rationale summary: prioritize high-trust channels (ABM + partners + thought leadership) to reach senior buyers and justify consultative product pricing. Use digital + marketplace to fill mid-market funnel and scale volume.

Specific action items (first 90 days)
- Build ABM 50 account plan: mapping stakeholders, content assets, outreach sequences.
- Legal & commercial template for partner referrals (two-sided revenue share).
- Calendar six executive roundtables for Q2/Q3 and 4 speaking slots at industry events.
- Launch targeted LinkedIn campaign for 4 ICP segments (Global CMO, Head of Growth, Innovation Director, Head of Campaigns).

2) Scalability Roadmap (from baseline to 10x)
Scenarios (adjust based on real baseline):
- Baseline: 12 sprints/month = £120k/month = £1.44m ARR.
- Target 10x: £14.4m ARR → 1,200 sprints/year → 100 sprints/month.

Three-phase roadmap (36 months)
Phase 0 — Stabilize & repeat (0–6 months)
- Target: 12 → 18 sprints/month (1.5x). Focus on tightening operations, core sales, pilot partners.
- Milestones: Standardised delivery playbook, 1 partner contract signed, 150 leads in pipeline.
Phase 1 — Productize & automate (6–18 months)
- Target: 18 → 50 sprints/month (x2.8 from baseline). Invest in templates, data connectors and partial self‑serve.
- Milestones: Automated data pipelines reduce analyst time per sprint by 30%; two platform partnerships; established ABM motion; 25% bookings from partners.
Phase 2 — Scale & industrialize (18–36 months)
- Target: 50 → 100 sprints/month to reach 10x. Scale teams, expand global sales, self-serve/mid-market product launched.
- Milestones: Self-serve portal live (20% of volume), 6 strategic partners delivering 30% of bookings, automation reduces labor per sprint by 50%.

Capacity math (how many teams)
- Conservative (no automation): 1 Sprint Team = 4 sprints/month. To reach 100 sprints/month → need 25 Sprint Teams.
- With automation (targeted ~2x throughput): 1 Sprint Team = 8 sprints/month → need 12–13 teams.
- Productized + marketplace/self-serve handling 20% of volume reduces team need further.

Key dependencies & constraints
- Data access & licensing costs (panels, social listening) scale and are recurring.
- Client stakeholder availability (must commit to week of collaboration).
- Talent supply for senior strategists/data scientists.
- Legal/compliance (GDPR) for multi-source data ingestion.

Action items per quarter (example)
- Q1: Build ops playbook; hire 2 Sprint Leads; sign first 2 panel/data partners.
- Q2: Deliver 30 sprints/month; build automation roadmap; launch ABM.
- Q3: Deploy first set of automated connectors; pilot self-serve funnel for SMB.
- Q4–Y2: Expand partner channel; hire 6 teams; double throughput via templates/automation; launch marketplace listing.

3) Operational Model — Delivery process, QC, resources
Delivery process (5-day sprint workflow)
- Pre-sprint (1–7 days before): Intake + access setup
  - Client kickoff brief (60 mins), NDAs, data access connectors (GA, social, CRM), stakeholder calendar.
  - Deliverable: Sprint brief & data checklist.
- Day 0: Kickoff & hypothesis alignment (remote or on-site)
  - Confirm KPIs, audience, territories, timeframes.
- Day 1–3: Data ingestion & AI synthesis
  - Pull multi-source data (social, search, owned analytics, panel).
  - Run AI pipelines (topic modelling, sentiment, trends, competitor mapping).
- Day 4: Expert interpretation & prioritisation
  - Senior strategist + data scientist workshop to convert signals into hypotheses.
  - Create candidate insight set, campaign implications, customer journeys, topline metrics.
- Day 5: Delivery & handover
  - 60–90 minute executive readout with slide pack + dashboard.
  - Provide 5 recommended campaign ideas, prioritized by impact & effort, confidence score, next‑steps roadmap.
- Post-sprint (0–30 days): Support/validation
  - 1 follow-up workshop (30–60 mins) and access to dashboard for 30 days.
  - Option: extended retainer for activation or monitoring.

Roles & capacity per sprint (typical)
- Sprint Lead / Senior Strategist (0.8 FTE-week)
- Data Scientist / AI Engineer (0.6 FTE-week)
- Research Analyst (0.8 FTE-week)
- Project Manager (0.3 FTE-week)
- Client Director / Seller (handover + 2 hrs)
- Design/UX (templates; 0.2 FTE as needed)
- External panel provider / vendor data (outsourced)

Full time equivalents (example throughput)
- One fully allocated team can operate ~1 sprint/week or ~4/month assuming full-time availability; with automation can reach 6–8/month.

Quality control (QC) — Hard checklist
- Data integrity: source traceability, date ranges verified, sample sizes noted.
- Methodology: explicit explanation of AI models used, prompt templates, human validation steps.
- Insight validity: each insight must have source links, confidence score, supporting evidence and suggested test.
- Ethical & legal: PII removed, GDPR check, bias audit steps.
- Executive readability: 1-pager TL;DR, 5 campaign ideas, 3 prioritized metrics.
- Post‑delivery QA: peer review of deck + signoff by Sprint Lead.

Tools & infrastructure
- ETL & connectors: Fivetran/Custom APIs
- Social listening: Brandwatch / Sprinklr / Meltwater (partner or license)
- Search & trends: Google Trends, SEMrush, SimilarWeb
- LLM & orchestration: hosted LLM + prompt templates (OpenAI + private LLM for sensitive data)
- Dashboarding: Looker/PowerBI/Google Data Studio
- Project management: Asana/Monday
- Knowledge base: Notion/Confluence with standardized templates

Operational constraints & mitigations
- Constraint: Data licensing cost grows with volume → negotiate enterprise pricing; build sampled approaches for small clients.
- Constraint: Senior strategist scarcity → create senior + mid-tier mix, develop training bootcamps and playbooks.
- Constraint: Client availability during sprint week → offer a “blocked week” calendar template and pre-sprint readiness checklist.

Action items (first 6 months)
- Build full sprint ops playbook and templates (deliverable library).
- Implement two automated data connectors (GA + Twitter/Meta).
- Hire 2 Sprint Leads and 2 Data Scientists.

4) Partnership Framework
Partner types
- Referral partners (independent agencies, consultants)
- Delivery partners (white-label data/analytics vendors)
- Data providers (panel vendors, social listening)
- Tech partners (BI tooling, LLM vendors)
- Channel partners (media agencies, creative agencies)

Commercial models
- Referral: simple kicker (10–20% of first sprint) or fixed finder’s fee.
- Reseller/white-label: lower price to partner + revenue share (30–50%).
- Co-sell strategic agreements: joint GTM with shared pipeline ownership and SLAs.
- Data partnerships: subscription or per-report pricing with capped margins.

Referral program design (practical)
- Tier 1: Strategic partners (signed contract, co-branded sales) → 20–30% revenue share first year; co-marketing commitments.
- Tier 2: Agency referrals (ad hoc) → 10% finder’s fee.
- Operational mechanics: partner portal, partner kit (sales pitch, one-pager, pricing), simple referral form, 30-day payout.

Strategic partnership targets (first 12 months)
- 2 global media/creative agency alliances

- Quarterly partner co-marketing calendar.

5) Marketing Engine — channel priorities, content strategy, lead generation
Channel priorities (ranked)
1. Thought Leadership / Executive Content (LinkedIn, long-form articles, founder POVs)
2. ABM + SDR outreach (targeted sequences to 50–100 accounts)
3. Event & Roundtables (invite-only)
4. Partnerships & Co-marketing
5. Paid LinkedIn + Intent Search for mid-market
6. PR & Analyst briefings

Content strategy (messages & assets)
- Pillars: Speed & Confidence; Competitive Edge; Practical AI Adoption; Case Studies (adidas, BMW, Nestlé examples).
- Asset types:
  - Executive 1-pager: “Campaign Insights in 5 Days” — quick proof points.
  - Case study pack: 3–4 case studies with measurable outcomes.
  - Product demo: 5-minute video + sample dashboard.
  - Playbooks: “How to run a research sprint” and “How to brief a sprint”.
  - Webinars: Monthly topic-driven (e.g., seasonal campaign insights).
  - Short LinkedIn thought pieces and CEO threads.

Lead generation playbook
- Top-of-funnel: LinkedIn thought leadership + paid for reach.
- Mid-funnel: ABM sequences + downloadable playbook + live demo.

7) Growth Levers — automation, productization, team expansion
Automation opportunities
- Data connectors: one-click connectors for GA, Meta, Twitter, YouTube, CRM — reduce manual ETL.
- Prompt library & LLM orchestration: standardized prompts and pipelines for common insight tasks; create reproducible chains to reduce analyst time by 30–50%.
- Reporting templates & dashboard automation: reusable templates reduce deck build time.
- Client portal for intake & delivery: reduces PM overhead and accelerates pre-sprint readiness.

Productization path
- Phase A — Core Consulted Product (today): 5-day white-glove sprint.
- Phase B — Assisted Self-Serve (6–12 months): clients use a guided intake with optional analyst time; lower price tier (£3–6k).
- Phase C — Full Self-Serve SaaS (18–36 months): subscription for mid-market — dashboard + automated insight packs + on-demand human upgrade.
- Enterprise tier: custom engagements, multi-market research, retainer for continuous insight.

Team expansion plan (by role & timeline)
- Year 0 (stabilize): Hire 2 Sprint Leads, 2 Data Scientists, 2 Analysts, 1 Ops PM, 1 Partnerships Lead.
- Year 1 (productize): Add 4 Sprint Leads, 4 Data Scientists, 6 Analysts, 1 Head of Productization, 1 Marketing lead (ABM), 2 SDRs.
- Year 2 (scale): Add 8 Sprint Leads, 8 Data Scientists, 12 Analysts, 4 PMs, Sales Director + 4 AEs, Partnerships manager, Customer Success team (3).
- Build internal training program (Brilliant Noise sprint academy) to ramp mid-level hires into Sprint Leads.

Team productivity KPIs
- Time-to-delivery per sprint (goal <5 days).
- Analyst hours per sprint (target 40% reduction through automation in 12 months).
- Utilisation rate per Sprint Lead (target 70% billable).
- Average deal size & ARR by channel.

Action items (first 12 months)
- Build automation backlog with prioritised connectors & prompt templates (MVP 3 connectors in 90 days).
- Develop assisted self-serve pilot and pricing.
- Create Sprint Academy curriculum & 6-week onboarding for new hires.
- Establish hiring plan and recruitment pipeline focused on hybrid strategist/AI background.

Capacity constraints — explicit
- Human talent: senior strategists are the bottleneck at scale. Mitigation: hire aggressively, internal training, and productise to reduce senior time per sprint.
- Data & vendor cost: panel and social listening fees rise with scale. Mitigation: negotiate volume discounts and mix of open data + proprietary sampling.
- Client readiness: clients must commit executive time during sprint week. Mitigation: pre-sprint readiness automation and clear client playbook.
- Compute & infra: LLM costs scale with volume. Mitigation: mix public and private LLM usage and negotiate vendor credits.

KPIs & milestones (example)
- Month 3: Ops playbook complete; pipeline 50 ABM accounts; 18 sprints/month capacity.
- Month 6: 30 sprints/month; first 2 partners signed; automation reduces manual ETL time 20%.
- Month 12: 50 sprints/month; assisted self-serve pilot live; 3 active delivery clusters; revenue ~£500k+/month.
- Month 24: 80 sprints/month; self-serve accounts cover 15% of volume; revenue ~£1.6m+/month.
- Month 36: 100+ sprints/month (10x target), partnerships contribute 30% of bookings.

Risk matrix & mitigations
- Risk: Quality dilution as volume grows → QC gates, central QA team, maintained senior sign-off.
- Risk: Price erosion from commoditisation → protect premium by owning interpretation, strategy and B‑Corp values narrative.
- Risk: Data/legal issues → legal signoff for all data connectors; privacy-by-design auditing.
