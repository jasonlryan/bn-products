# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • User Stories

Below are 9 structured user-story cards for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint. They are grouped by persona and journey stage. Each card follows the Agile format and includes Acceptance Criteria (3–4 testable conditions), Priority, and Business Value focused on the user outcome.

-----------------------
Persona: CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)
Journey stage: Discovery

User Story 1
As a CMO, I want a 5‑day synthesis that surfaces the top 3 campaign opportunities and their estimated impact, so that I can decide whether to greenlight a campaign within one business week.
Acceptance Criteria
- Delivered synthesis document received within 5 business days from kickoff.
- Document lists Top 3 opportunities with one-line behavioural insight, supporting evidence from at least two distinct data sources (e.g., social + search), and a confidence score for each opportunity.
- Each opportunity includes a measurable estimated outcome (e.g., potential reach, expected conversion uplift or revenue range) and a recommended next step (experiment or campaign) with timeline.
- CMO can make a yes/no go decision based only on the synthesis (validated by stakeholder sign-off within 2 business days).
Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Enables rapid, evidence-based decisions that reduce time-to-launch and avoid costly delays or gut-led campaigns.

User Story 2
As a CMO, I want a competitor blind‑spot comparison that identifies 1–2 distinct positioning gaps competitors are not exploiting, so that we can target those gaps and increase our share-of-voice in the target segment within 3 months.
Acceptance Criteria
- A ranked list of competitors analysed and the data sources used for each.
- At least 2 validated competitor blind spots, each with supporting evidence and an actionable positioning hypothesis.
- Baseline metric(s) defined (e.g., current share-of-voice or engagement in target segment) and projected uplift estimates for each hypothesis.
- Recommendation of the highest-priority blind-spot to test, with a suggested KPI and 90-day experiment plan.
Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Reveals defensible, differentiated positioning quickly to gain competitive advantage where rivals are weak.

Persona: Marketing Manager / Campaign Lead
Journey stage: Purchase

User Story 3
As a Campaign Lead, I want a cost‑effective research alternative that delivers equivalent confidence to a £30k study at £10k, so that my team can reallocate budget to media and launch faster while maintaining stakeholder trust.
Acceptance Criteria
- A cost-comparison summary showing deliverables and coverage vs. a typical £30k study, with explicit trade-offs documented.
- Deliverables equivalent in outcome (insights, prioritized opportunities, testable hypotheses) are present and accepted by at least two internal stakeholders (marketing and finance).
- Finance confirms budget approval for the sprint based on the cost comparison and projected ROI within the agreed procurement timeline.
- Sprint kickoff is scheduled and executed within procurement timelines to enable launch of the resulting campaign within 2 weeks of sprint completion.
Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Frees up budget for campaign execution and shortens the decision-to-launch window while maintaining confidence in research quality.

Journey stage: Onboarding

User Story 4
As a Campaign Lead, I want a practical onboarding session that converts sprint insights into an executable 2‑week campaign plan, so that my team can begin production immediately and reduce planning time by at least 50%.
Acceptance Criteria
- A facilitated onboarding workshop scheduled within 48 hours of deliverable delivery with all key execution stakeholders present.
- An output 2‑week plan with clear task owners, milestones, and resource estimates (creative, media, approvals) that the campaign team can start executing.
- Stakeholder sign-off on the plan during or immediately after the session.
- Plan includes at least one A/B test hypothesis derived from the sprint insights, with success metrics and tracking defined.
Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Converts insight into action quickly, avoiding lost time between research and execution and improving speed-to-market.

-----------------------
Persona: Insights / Research Lead
Journey stage: Discovery

User Story 5
As an Insights Lead, I want triangulated evidence from social, search and owned analytics with confidence metrics, so that I can defend our recommendations to stakeholders and reduce evidence-gathering time by ~80%.
Acceptance Criteria
- For each insight, the source(s) of evidence are listed and include at least two distinct data streams (social, search, owned analytics or panel).
- Each insight shows a quantitative confidence score and a short methodology note describing how the score was derived.
- All insights include representative source examples (screenshots/links or query snapshots) sufficient for audit or validation.
- A reproducible summary of analytical steps is provided so the insight can be independently re-run or validated by the insights team.
Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Strengthens credibility of recommendations, speeds stakeholder buy-in, and reduces the time and effort required to verify evidence.

Journey stage: Success

User Story 6
As an Insights Lead, I want a custom monitoring dashboard for the sprint's chosen KPIs so that I can detect meaningful trend changes within 48 hours and report progress to stakeholders weekly.
Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard provisioned and accessible to named stakeholders within 5 business days of sprint completion.
- Dashboard tracks the agreed KPIs, auto-refreshes at a frequency that meets the 48‑hour detection requirement, and includes baseline and target values.
- Automated weekly report or snapshot is scheduled and delivered to stakeholders (email or shared location).
- Dashboard permissions and a short user guide are provided so stakeholders can view and interpret the metrics without additional help.
Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Enables continuous performance tracking, rapid course correction and more accountable reporting on experiments informed by the sprint.

-----------------------
Persona: Innovation Director / CDO
Journey stage: Evaluation

User Story 7
As an Innovation Director, I want scenario-based recommendations with estimated ROI and risk sensitivity so that I can prioritise 2–3 investment opportunities and forecast expected returns within 90 days.
Acceptance Criteria
- At least 3 opportunity scenarios presented, each with estimated costs, projected returns (revenue uplift or cost savings), and time-to-impact assumptions.
- A sensitivity analysis or range of outcomes for each scenario that highlights key drivers and risks.
- A ranked recommendation with rationale for prioritisation, including a suggested pilot/experiment to validate the highest-priority scenario.
- An executive summary that allows for decision-making at the leadership level without needing additional technical briefings.
Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Helps leadership allocate scarce innovation budget to the highest-ROI, lowest-risk options with evidence-based prioritisation.

-----------------------
Persona: Brand Manager
Journey stage: Onboarding / Purchase

User Story 8
As a Brand Manager, I want concise evidence decks and 3 creative hooks derived from sprint insights so that the creative team can test concepts immediately and at least one concept achieves a statistically significant uplift in an A/B test within 4 weeks.
Acceptance Criteria
- A concise deck (top-line insights + 3 prioritized creative hooks) delivered at sprint close.
- Each creative hook includes a testable hypothesis, target audience, suggested creative direction, and primary KPI for the A/B test.
- The creative team has what they need to set up a test (briefs, sample copy, suggested targeting) and confirms readiness to run within 7 days.
- Post-test success criteria defined (statistical significance threshold and expected minimum uplift).
Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Accelerates concept testing and increases the chance of rapid, measurable impact from campaign creative rooted in evidence.

Journey stage: Success

User Story 9
As a Brand Manager, I want a post‑sprint retrospective and short playbook summarising lessons and templates, so that future sprints are 30% faster and more consistent.
Acceptance Criteria
- A 60–90 minute retrospective session held within 7 days of sprint close with key stakeholders.
- A short playbook delivered containing top learnings, tested hypotheses, templates (brief, dashboard), and at least 3 recommended process improvements with owners assigned.
- An adoption target is set (e.g., apply 2 playbook templates to next sprint) and owners acknowledge responsibility.
- Measurable target for speed improvement is defined for the next sprint (e.g., reduce planning time by 30%) and tracked.
Priority: Could Have
Business Value: Captures institutional knowledge, reduces ramp time for future sprints, and improves consistency and quality of future outcomes.

-----------------------
Notes/Guidance for implementation
- Priorities reflect user outcomes and should be validated with sales and delivery teams; Must Have stories enable the core value proposition (5-day, evidence-backed, actionable insights).
- Acceptance Criteria intentionally emphasise measurable, testable outcomes (timelines, sign-offs, KPI definitions) so each story can be validated in sprint reviews and client acceptance.
- Consider adding acceptance gating for data privacy/consent and compliance where third-party data sources are used.

If you want, I can:
- Expand any story into tasks for delivery teams (e.g., workshop agenda, dashboard spec).
- Convert these into JIRA-ready tickets with estimates and dependencies.
