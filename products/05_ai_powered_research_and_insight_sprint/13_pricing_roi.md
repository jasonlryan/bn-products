# AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint • Pricing Roi

Below is a concise, actionable business model and pricing analysis for Brilliant Noise’s AI‑Powered Research & Insight Sprint (5 days, list price £10,000).

1) Business Model Canvas (key points)
- Key partners: panel providers, social/listening vendors, LLM & cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS), analytics connectors (GA, Brandwatch), strategic channel partners (agency networks).
- Key activities: data ingestion & AI synthesis, insight interpretation, rapid reporting, client workshops, template & IP development.
- Key resources: expert team (senior strategist, data scientist, researcher, PM), reusable pipelines & prompts, dashboards, data subscriptions, training content.
- Value propositions: 80% faster, evidence‑backed campaign decisions at ~1/3 cost of traditional research; boutique strategic expertise + B‑Corp values.
- Customer segments: CMOs/CDOs/Innovation leads at global & fast‑moving brands.
- Channels: direct sales, partner referrals, thought leadership, targeted ABM.
- Customer relationships: productized delivery + optional retainer dashboards and activation support.
- Cost structure: variable delivery staffing + tooling & API usage; fixed: platform engineering, dedicated sales & marketing, IP build.
- Revenue streams: one‑off Sprint (£10k), Sprint+ tiers (multi‑market/extended), dashboard subscriptions, activation/retainer projects.

2) Unit Economics (assumptions & calc)
Assumptions (per 5‑day Sprint):
- Team hours: Senior strategist 12h (£150/hr), Data scientist 12h (£120/hr), Researcher 24h (£60/hr), PM 6h (£70/hr).
- Staff cost = £5,100. Tooling/data subscriptions & panels = £800. LLM/API & cloud = £300. Reporting/templates = £150. Allocated overhead (sales/office) = £650.
- Total cost per delivery (base) = £7,000.

Metrics:
- Price = £10,000 → Gross profit = £3,000 → Gross margin = 30%.
- Optimised (automation + higher utilisation): reduce staff + tooling by £1,500 → cost £5,500 → margin 45% (profit £4,500).
Breakeven (fixed annual product costs e.g., platform & dedicated sales = £180,000):
- At £3,000 contribution per Sprint → 60 Sprints/year.
- At £4,500 contribution → 40 Sprints/year.
Actionable: target 40–60 Sprints/year to fully cover product fixed costs; aim to reach >45% margin via automation.

3) Pricing Strategy
- Model justification: value‑based anchor vs traditional research (£30k+ and 4–6 weeks). Price offers high value (speed + insight) and is accessible to marketing teams under time pressure.
- Tiering (recommended):
  - Core Sprint: £10,000 (5‑day, single market).
  - Sprint+ (adds panel / deeper segmentation): £18,000.
  - Enterprise Multi‑market Sprint: £35,000 (multi‑country, localised data).
- Competitive positioning: premium rapid research — boutique strategic partner (not commodity tech or MBB).
- Price testing framework:
  - A/B test enterprise inbound: present Core vs Sprint+ to 100 leads, measure conversion & willingness to pay.
  - Time-limited pilot discounts (10%) to top 5 target accounts; monitor expansion rate.
  - Track conversion by ICP, deal size, and attach of upsells to validate price elasticity.

4) Scalability Analysis
- Capacity constraints: senior strategist availability, panel quotas, LLM costs and quality control.
- Path to scale:
  1. Productise intake and templates (reduce scoping time).
  2. Hire a 2:1 junior:senior bench to increase parallel sprints.
  3. Centralise data connectors & dashboards to reuse pipelines.
  4. Partner with panel suppliers for enterprise rates.
- Automation opportunities & impact:
  - Automated connectors & standard prompts → cut Data Scientist hours 40–60% (saves £600–£900 per Sprint).
  - Auto‑report generation (templated narratives) → reduce researcher hours.
  - Result: push margin to 45–55% and scale to 150–200 Sprints/year with modest headcount growth.

5) ROI Framework (customer view)
Assumptions: customer campaign baseline revenue £1,000,000; gross margin 20%; Sprint cost £10,000.

Scenarios (incremental revenue uplift due to insight-driven targeting):
- Conservative: 5% uplift → incremental revenue £50,000 → incremental gross profit £10,000 → payback = 1 Sprint (2 weeks of campaign).
- Base: 10% uplift → incremental profit £20,000 → payback = 0.5 Sprint.
- Aggressive: 20% uplift → incremental profit £40,000 → payback = 0.25 Sprint.
Value metrics to sell: time-to-insight (5 days vs 35+), expected uplift %, risk reduction (reduced failed creative spend), confidence score (probability of uplift).

6) Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell opportunities: Sprint+ (deeper research), activation & creative testing, campaign optimisation retainer, custom dashboards, annual insight subscriptions, training & capability build.
- Recurring potential: dashboard subscription (£1,000–£2,000/mo) and monthly insight check-ins.
- Assumptions for CLTV:
  - Avg client buys 2 Sprints/year @£10k = £20k.
  - 30% buy dashboard @£1,000/mo = £3.6k/year.
  - Annual revenue per client = £23.6k. Gross margin (post‑automation) ≈ 45% → contribution ≈ £10.6k/year.
  - 3‑year retention → CLTV ≈ £31.8k.
Actionable insights:
- Drive attach rate for Sprint+ and dashboard (goal: 40% attach → +£5–10k ACV).
- Incentivise multi‑Sprint bundles/retainers (discounted bundles) to increase frequency and retention.
- Build referral incentives & partner channels to lower CAC and hit the 40–60 Sprint breakeven target.

Bottom line: Priced at £10k, the Sprint is a compelling value play vs £30k+ research. To be profitable and scalable, focus immediate investments on automation, reusable pipelines, and converting Core buyers into Sprint+ or dashboard subscribers to improve margins and CLTV.
