## Generated Output

Certainly, here's how you can approach the UI frames for the Landing, Main Task, and Success screens for the Social Intelligence Dashboard.

**1. Landing Screen: Dashboard Homepage**

The landing screen should offer a clean and concise overview of the platform. It should include:

- **Navigation Bar:** Located at the top, it should include links to the main sections: WRI Analysis, Competitor Analysis, Market Research Reports and Settings/Profile. It should also have a company logo that redirects to the homepage when clicked.

- **Summary Card:** This should be a prominent card on the page, displaying the most recent key metrics from the WRI Analysis.

- **Competitor Analysis Preview:** A small chart or graph visualizing a key aspect of the latest competitor analysis.

- **Recent Reports:** Display recent market research reports with their titles, brief descriptions, and a 'View Report' call-to-action button.

- **Notifications:** An area that displays important updates or alerts related to the user's market research.

**2. Main Task Screen: WRI Analysis Page**

This page is where users engage with the primary function of the platform. It should include:

- **Filter Tool:** A tool allowing users to filter the WRI Analysis data by different categories, attributes, or regions.

- **WRI Analysis Chart:** An interactive chart visualizing the scores and rankings of the 20 key product attributes. Users should be able to hover over or click on chart elements to see more detailed data.

- **Attribute Details:** When an attribute in the chart is selected, this area should display more detailed information about the attribute, including its definition, importance, and trend over time.

**3. Success Screen: Market Research Report View**

The success screen is where users can view a complete market research report. It should include:

- **Report Title:** The report's title at the top of the page.

- **PDF Viewer:** An interactive, searchable PDF viewer displaying the report. It should include standard controls for zooming, scrolling, and navigating pages.

- **Download Button:** A button allowing users to download the report as a PDF.

- **Related Reports:** A section displaying other reports that might be of interest to the user.

For the design style, maintain a professional, data-centric look throughout. Use bold headline typography for titles and subtitles, and ensure all text is clear and readable. Use rounded components for a modern, friendly feel. For colors, use a neutral color palette for the overall dashboard, with more vibrant colors for charts, graphs, and other key visual elements. Make sure all interactive elements have clear hover and click states to enhance usability.

Overall, the goal is to create a user-friendly interface that makes complex market research data easy to understand and interact with, helping users make informed decisions quickly and effectively.
