# AI-B-C™ • Functional Specification

AI-B-C™ — Functional Specification (business-focused)

1) Overview (what it does)
- AI-B-C™ is a modular enterprise upskilling and transformation program that turns teams into AI power users in 90 days. It converts awareness into repeatable daily practice so organisations realise measurable productivity gains (target: 20+ hours saved per person/month) and competitive advantage. Delivered via a Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach: executive alignment, role-specific capability building, hands‑on practice, and measurable reinforcement.

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Executive sponsor and success criteria (business KPIs to affect)
- Target audience list (teams, roles, headcount) and training capacity
- Current AI/toolset inventory and any vendor restrictions
- Representative real-work scenarios, workflows and sample tasks
- Baseline productivity and time-spent metrics (for measurement)
- Schedule windows for executive briefing and workshop days
- Procurement/contract sign-off and budget (package selection: Executive Briefing £2,000; Team Workshop Day £8,800; Complete Sprint £17,500)

3) Core Process (step‑by‑step how it works)
- 0. Contract & scope: agree package, participants, target KPIs, timelines.
- 1. Executive Briefing (90 mins): align leadership on opportunity, risks, target adoption metrics and governance.
- 2. Diagnostic: rapid assessment of skills, workflows, tool gaps and priority use-cases using client-supplied scenarios.
- 3. Curriculum design: map modular, role-specific learning paths and success metrics tailored to priority use-cases.
- 4. Team Workshops (hands‑on): immersive sessions applying AI to real tasks; templates, prompts and playbooks created live.
- 5. Sprint practice (30–90 days): short, supported sprints where participants apply learnings to day-to-day work; coaching and checkpoints.
- 6. Progress tracking & measurement: collect usage, time-saved estimates, qualitative feedback and KPI movement against baseline.
- 7. Reinforcement & governance: establish ongoing capability plan, champion network, tool policy recommendations and next-phase roadmap.

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Executive briefing deck with agreed success metrics and governance checklist
- Diagnostic report with priority use-case mapping and gap analysis
- Modular curriculum and role-specific learning paths
- Workshop artefacts: prompts, templates, playbooks, recorded exercises
- Sprint plan and participant action lists
- Progress reports (adoption, time-saved estimates, KPI movement) and final impact summary
- Recommendations for scale: champion programme, tooling policy and next steps
- Optional: case-study-ready summary and ongoing support package

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Adoption: ≥90% of target participants using AI weekly within 30 days (primary)
- Productivity: average ≥20 hours/month time saved per active user (target)
- Engagement: ≥80% workshop completion and active participation
- Business impact: measurable movement in one or more sponsor KPIs within 90 days (e.g., campaign velocity, content throughput, cost/time per task)
- Satisfaction: client NPS ≥ +30 from participants; executive sign-off on ROI case

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Outcome depends on client engagement, executive sponsorship and allocated time for practice
- Measured time-savings are estimates based on task sampling; attribution to AI vs other changes may vary
- Impact limited by existing tool policies, data access, and procurement cycles
- Behavioural change may require ongoing reinforcement beyond 90 days for sustained adoption
- Not a technology implementation service; integrations or enterprise tooling rollouts are out of scope unless contracted separately
