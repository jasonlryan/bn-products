# AI-B-C™ • User Stories

Below are 9 user-story cards for AI-B-C™, organised by persona and journey stage. Each card uses the Agile format, with 3–4 testable Acceptance Criteria, a Priority level, and Business Value focused on user outcomes.

— Persona group: CMO (Executive buyer)

User Story Card 1 — Discovery
- Persona: Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
- Journey stage: Discovery
- User story: As a CMO, I want a tailored 90‑minute executive briefing that translates AI opportunity into business metrics, so that I can decide within two weeks whether to sponsor an AI upskilling programme and communicate a clear expected ROI to the CEO.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Briefing is delivered in 90 minutes with a bespoke slide pack that includes company-specific examples and market context.
  2. The pack contains a one‑page ROI estimate showing expected hours saved per FTE, projected cost savings, and break‑even timeline (with assumptions).
  3. The session closes with a recommended next step and a stakeholder map for approvals, captured as an action list with owners and timelines.
  4. CMO can present the one‑page summary to the CEO; within 2 weeks the CMO records a yes/no decision on sponsorship.
- Priority: Must Have
- Business Value: Enables fast, evidence‑based executive buy‑in and reduces decision latency so the organisation can move quickly to capture competitive advantage.

User Story Card 2 — Evaluation
- Persona: Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
- Journey stage: Evaluation
- User story: As a CMO, I want to see role‑specific case studies and KPI models for organisations like ours, so that I can compare expected outcomes against other initiatives and justify budget allocation quantitatively.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Delivery of at least three relevant case studies mapped to marketing roles (e.g., content, paid media, analytics) with before/after metrics.
  2. A KPI model that projects % weekly AI adoption, average hours saved per role, and expected impact on revenue or campaign throughput given stated assumptions.
  3. Sensitivity analysis showing best/likely/worst outcome ranges and key dependencies.
  4. Verifiable client references (contact details or testimonials) for at least one relevant case.
- Priority: Should Have
- Business Value: Gives the CMO confidence to prioritise AI training over competing investments by quantifying benefits and risks.

— Persona group: Chief Digital Officer / Procurement (Technical/C-suite buyer)

User Story Card 3 — Purchase (CDO)
- Persona: Chief Digital Officer (CDO)

- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Plan includes weekly milestones, role‑level resource allocation (FTE-days), and a RACI for internal stakeholders.
  2. Success metrics are defined (e.g., % of cohort using AI weekly, average hours saved per person, baseline and target) and a measurement method is specified.
  3. A risk register lists top 5 risks with mitigations and contingency plans.
  4. Finance receives a cost breakdown and projected ROI that supports procurement approval.
- Priority: Must Have
- Business Value: Reduces implementation uncertainty and secures cross‑functional resource commitment, enabling a timely rollout with measurable returns.

— Persona group: Innovation Director (Product/R&D/Change lead)

User Story Card 4 — Evaluation (Pilot design)
- Persona: Innovation Director
- Journey stage: Evaluation
- User story: As an Innovation Director, I want a pilot design that maps learning activities to real team outputs, so that we can validate in 30 days whether 90% of participants will use AI weekly and achieve measurable time savings.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Pilot scope defines cohort size, participant roles, three real work tasks to be improved, and current baseline metrics for those tasks.
  2. Learning path and workshop schedule are aligned to the tasks and include at least one live coached session and one follow‑up check‑in.
  3. Success criteria are explicit: target weekly usage %, minimum average hours saved per person, and acceptance thresholds for roll‑out decision.
  4. Baseline measurements captured before pilot and a post‑pilot measurement plan scheduled within 7 days of pilot completion.
- Priority: Must Have
- Business Value: Enables a low‑risk, fast experiment to prove behaviour change and quantify impact before scaling.

— Persona group: L&D / People & Culture

User Story Card 5 — Purchase / Onboarding (L&D Lead)
- Persona: Head of Learning & Development
- Journey stage: Purchase / Onboarding
- User story: As Head of L&D, I want modular, role‑specific learning paths with measurable progress tracking, so that I can demonstrate 90% weekly AI use among participants and report productivity gains to HR and the executive team.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Learning paths are mapped to at least three roles (e.g., marketer, analyst, product manager) with measurable learning outcomes per module.
  2. A progress tracking plan is provided (who reports what, how often) and includes baseline, mid‑point, and 30‑day adoption metrics.
  3. Reporting templates are supplied for HR and execs showing % active users, module completion rates, and estimated hours saved.
  4. Integration points with existing L&D systems (or a manual process) are documented to enable tracking within 30 days.
- Priority: Must Have
- Business Value: Allows L&D to show programme effectiveness, secure future learning budgets, and tie AI capability to retention and performance metrics.

— Persona group: Team Lead / Manager (Marketing Operations, Creative Lead)

User Story Card 6 — Onboarding (Team Workshop)
- Persona: Marketing Team Lead
- Journey stage: Onboarding
- User story: As a Marketing Team Lead, I want a hands‑on workshop that uses our real tasks and content, so that my team can start saving 20+ hours per person per month within 30 days.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. Workshop includes at least three real, pre‑submitted team tasks (e.g., campaign brief, copy draft, reporting query) and guided exercises to apply AI to those tasks.
  2. Each participant completes tasks during the workshop and produces work outputs that are demonstrably improved or faster to produce.
  3. Post‑workshop follow‑up coaching is scheduled (one session within 7–14 days) and an adoption check at 30 days is planned.
  4. Participants self‑report time‑to‑complete for at least one task pre/post workshop, showing measurable time reduction.
- Priority: Must Have
- Business Value: Converts theoretical learning into immediate productivity gains and creates tangible proof points for scaling across teams.

User Story Card 7 — Onboarding (Individual contributor)
- Persona: Senior Copywriter (Individual Contributor)
- Journey stage: Onboarding

  1. A post‑programme report correlates training participation with at least two performance indicators (e.g., campaign throughput, time‑to‑market, or conversion uplift) and with retention/change in voluntary turnover in the trained cohort.
  2. The report includes a narrative case (1–2 pages) showing one concrete example where AI use shortened a campaign cycle or improved a KPI, with quantifiable impact.
  3. Recommendations for next steps and a proposed roadmap for scaling are included, with estimated incremental ROI.

If you’d like, I can:
- Expand any card into more detailed tasks for sprint planning (user tasks, dependencies).
- Convert these into JIRA‑ready ticket templates with story points and acceptance test scripts.
- Create additional persona stories (e.g., Procurement, Legal/compliance) or reduce/increase the set to match your release plan. Which would be most helpful next?
