# AI-B-C™ • Market Sizing

Below I estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI‑B‑C™’s primary market (AI upskilling & transformation for marketing/product teams in medium→large enterprises) using both Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up methods. I show formulas, explicit assumptions (with reasoning / best‑guess sources), produce TAM / SAM / SOM, include a sensitivity analysis (±20% on key assumptions), and finish with three concise go‑to‑market implications.

Summary (quick view)
- Top‑Down TAM (base case): ≈ £1.0B (range £0.52B – £1.74B)
- Bottom‑Up TAM (base case): ≈ £4.0B (range £2.56B – £5.76B)
- Reconciled/Recommended TAM (midpoint of the methods): ≈ £2.5B
- Recommended SAM (Brilliant Noise’s serviceable market given focus on global brands & premium positioning): ≈ £750M (30% of TAM)
- Recommended SOM (near-term / 12–24 months achievable): ≈ £11–15M (≈1.5–2% of SAM). 3‑year target SOM: ≈ £45M (≈6% of SAM).

I. Definitions & approach
- TAM = total revenue opportunity for AI upskilling & transformation services for marketing/product teams in enterprises (global).
- SAM = portion of TAM addressable given Brilliant Noise’s positioning (global brands, B‑Corp, Brighton-based boutique, premium price).
- SOM = realistic market share Brilliant Noise can capture in near term (12–24 months) given current scale; and a 3‑year aspirational figure.

II. Top‑Down approach
Formula (Top‑Down):
TAM_TD = Global_Corporate_L&D_Spend × Share_50+_firms × Share_for_marketing/product_teams × Share_of_L&D_allocated_to_AI_upskilling

Assumptions & reasoning (each explicitly stated)
1. Global corporate L&D market (2023/24) ≈ $360B → convert at $1.25/£1 → £288B.
   - Rationale: industry reports (various market research summaries of corporate training / L&D / e‑learning) cluster in the low hundreds of billions; I use a conservative midpoint of $360B (callout: estimates vary $300–$450B depending on definitions).
2. Share of L&D spend by enterprises with 50+ employees = 70% → large firms drive most L&D budgets.
   - Rationale: small firms spend much less; mid/large firms (the ICP) consume the majority.
3. Share of that spend applied to marketing/product teams = 10%.
   - Rationale: L&D spans many functions; marketing/product are significant but not dominant.
4. Share of marketing/product L&D allocated specifically to AI / automation / advanced digital upskilling = 5%
   - Rationale: AI upskilling is a rising but still small portion of budgets today; 3–7% plausible near term.

Calculation (base):
TAM_TD = £288B × 0.70 × 0.10 × 0.05 = £1.008B

Top‑Down sensitivity (±20% applied to key % assumptions: 50+ share, marketing share, AI share)
- Worst case (−20% on all): 288 × 0.56 × 0.08 × 0.04 = £0.52B
- Best case (+20% on all): 288 × 0.84 × 0.12 × 0.06 = £1.74B
=> Top‑Down range: ≈ £0.52B – £1.74B (base ≈ £1.01B)

III. Bottom‑Up approach
Formula (Bottom‑Up):
TAM_BU = Number_of_target_companies × Average_annual_revenue_per_customer (ARPA)

Assumptions & reasoning
1. Target company definition for AI‑B‑C™: enterprises with 150+ employees (ideal client profile: medium→large, global brands). This product is also "perfect for 50+ employees" but marketing/product teams in 150+ firms are primary buyers.
2. Number of target companies globally (150+ employees): base = 160,000
   - Rationale / best‑guess logic: rough aggregation of mid+large enterprises across developed markets (US, EU, UK, Australia, Canada, Japan) and large corporates globally. (This is an estimate; sensitivity analysis will show impact.)
3. Average annual revenue per customer (ARPA) = £25,000
   - Rationale: pricing: Executive Briefing £2k, Team Workshop £8.8k, Complete Sprint £17.5k. Typical client buys a Complete Sprint or workshop(s) and follow‑on support; premium global brands may buy multiple sprints / enterprise packages → average £20k–£30k reasonable. I use £25k as base.

Calculation (base):
TAM_BU = 160,000 × £25,000 = £4,000,000,000 = £4.0B

Bottom‑Up sensitivity (±20% on two drivers)
- Companies: 128k → 192k (−20% / +20%)
- ARPA: £20k → £30k (−20% / +20%)
Compute extreme combos:
- Low‑low: 128k × £20k = £2.56B
- Base: 160k × £25k = £4.0B
- High‑high: 192k × £30k = £5.76B
=> Bottom‑Up range: ≈ £2.56B – £5.76B

IV. Reconciling Top‑Down & Bottom‑Up → Recommended TAM
- Top‑Down base ≈ £1.01B; Bottom‑Up base ≈ £4.0B. These are different because top‑down 1) uses a conservative share of AI budgets and 2) constrains to marketing team fraction of L&D.
- Recommended approach: present a reconciled TAM = midpoint of the two approaches (simple average) to reflect both market‑level and customer‑level perspectives: (1.01B + 4.0B) / 2 ≈ £2.5B.
- Reported TAM (recommended): ≈ £2.5B (range across methods ≈ £0.52B – £5.76B; a more realistic working range = £1.0B–£5.8B).

V. SAM & SOM (with rationale)
- SAM (Serviceable Available Market) — given Brilliant Noise’s premium boutique positioning, proven global brand case studies, and focus on marketing/product teams in developed markets, assume Brilliant Noise can address roughly 30% of the TAM (concentrating on large/enterprise segments and geographies where they already have traction).
  - SAM = 30% × £2.5B = £750M
  - Rationale: higher than a small boutique’s pure geography would imply because Brilliant Noise already works with global brands (adidas, BMW, Nestle). 30% reflects selective targeting of high‑value customers rather than mass market.
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
  - Near term (12–24 months, realistic given current capacity and sales velocity): capture ≈1.5–2.0% of SAM.
    - SOM_yr1–2 = 1.5% × £750M = £11.25M → 2.0% × £750M = £15.0M
    - So near‑term SOM ≈ £11–15M (ARR / annual revenue)
  - 3‑year target (with investment in sales, partners, productization): 5–8% of SAM.
    - SOM_3yr = 6% × £750M ≈ £45M (midpoint target)

VI. Sensitivity summary (key variables ±20%) — condensed table style (numbers in £)
- Top‑Down (AI share/marketing share/50+ share varying) → TAM ≈ £0.52B – £1.74B
- Bottom‑Up (companies × ARPA varying) → TAM ≈ £2.56B – £5.76B
- Combined/recommended TAM = £2.5B (use with caution; plan for scenarios)

Practical numeric scenarios (rounded)
- Conservative TAM scenario (top‑down pessimistic): ~£0.6B
- Base TAM scenario (recommended midpoint): ~£2.5B
- Aggressive TAM scenario (bottom‑up optimistic): ~£5.8B

VII. Key assumptions & sources / logic recap
- Global corporate L&D market: assumed $360B (industry reports vary; adjust if you prefer $300–$450B).
- Exchange rate: $1.25 = £1 (use your actual FX for final planning).
- Target company counts: estimated 160k companies with 150+ staff globally (best‑guess). If you have customer analytics or country firm counts, replace this with data‑driven counts.
- ARPA = £25k/year assumed based on product price points and expected follow‑on purchases.
- Share allocations (marketing share of L&D, AI share) are directional estimates reflecting market dynamics (AI being an accelerating but still minority share of total L&D spend today).

VIII. Three implications for go‑to‑market (concise, actionable)
1. Prioritise high‑ARPA accounts (enterprise global brands) — they drive most revenue:
   - Rationale: TAM math shows large enterprises unlock outsized revenue. Pursue a “land big accounts” approach (target CMOs/CDOs at global brands), where a single Complete Sprint + follow‑on support yields high lifetime value. Invest in account‑based marketing and case studies.
2. Productise and build scalable delivery to increase SOM rapidly:
   - Rationale: boutique consultancies scale slowly unless productised. Create productised packages, digital assets, train‑the‑trainer programs and a licensing model so you can increase throughput without linear headcount growth (this lifts ARPA potential and attainable share of SAM).
3. Build distribution partnerships and performance ROI proof:
   - Rationale: to convert enterprise buyers faster and expand capacity, partner with HR/L&D platforms, learning marketplaces, and complementary consultancies; and lead with quantified ROI (hours saved × salary cost models) in sales collateral to shorten procurement cycles.

IX. How to tighten estimates (next steps / recommended data pulls)
- Replace the 160k target‑company estimate with authoritative firm‑counts by employee band for target geographies (ONS / Eurostat / US Census / Orbis).
- Replace ARPA with CRM/historic win data (average sale per account, churn, upsell).
- Get up‑to‑date L&D market studies if you want to push a more aggressive Top‑Down number (Gartner, Fosway, Global Market Insights, or similar).
- Run a pilot funnel forecast (number of target accounts contacted → conversion → average deal size) to convert SOM into a hiring & revenue plan.

If you’d like, I can:
- Recompute this model using your real CRM / pipeline numbers (company counts, historic ARPA).
- Produce a 3‑year revenue plan (hi/mid/lo) showing how many deals to close per quarter to hit the SOM targets.
