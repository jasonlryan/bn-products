- Move from “AI awareness” to routine AI-enabled workflows across marketing teams within one quarter.

### Pain Points
- Campaign concept-to-live cycles take 4–8 weeks due to manual content creation and approvals.
- Fragmented tools and vendor sprawl — inconsistent output quality and wasted spend.
- Marketing ops and creative teams spend 30–40% of time on manual, repetitive tasks (brief writing, basic copy, image variants).
- Difficulty quantifying productivity gains from training or pilots — procurement demands hard ROI.

### Success Looks Like

- Program ROI delivered within 6 months (measured as cost savings + incremental revenue vs program cost).

### Budget Authority
- Typically can approve up to £25k–£75k autonomously for marketing programs; larger investments (£75k–£250k) require CFO or CEO sign-off.
- Likely to purchase a Visible Pilot: Team Workshop Day (£8,800) or Complete Sprint (£17,500) as initial proof.

### Buying Process
- Stakeholders: CMO (sponsor), Head of Marketing Ops, Head of Creative, Data/Analytics lead, Procurement, CFO.
- Evaluation criteria: measurable productivity gains, case studies with global brands, security & data handling, speed to value.
