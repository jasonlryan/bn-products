# AI-B-C™ • Presentation Structure

AI‑B‑C™ — Sales Presentation Playbook
Purpose: A repeatable, modular sales presentation structure your team can use for 30‑minute pitches, 90‑minute executive briefings and longer workshops. Includes a 10‑slide core deck outline (headlines + key talking points), optional deep‑dive modules (technical, ROI, implementation), audience customization guidance, and visual/demo insertion points. Each slide includes time allocations and transition phrases.

1) Core 10‑Slide Deck (compact + extendable)
Notes: Two timing schemas shown per slide — Quick Pitch (30m total: ~20–25m presentation + 5–10m Q&A) and Executive Briefing (90m total: ~60–75m presentation + 15–30m interactive work/Q&A). Use the short times for cold calls / discovery meetings; use extended times during paid Executive Briefings.

6) Transition Phrases (library to keep presenters fluent)
- From Problem → Solution: “Given those challenges, here’s a practical route to adoption.”
- From Solution → How It Works: “This is what that looks like day to day.”
- From How → Proof: “But does it actually deliver? Here’s the evidence.”
- From Proof → Pricing: “So here’s how we package this for teams your size.”
- From Pricing → Integration: “A common question is how this connects to your stack — here’s the approach.”
- From Integration → Implementation: “And here’s the timeline to make it happen.”
- From Implementation → ROI: “Let’s translate those steps into the expected business return.”
- Closing: “If you’re aligned, the next step is a focused Executive Briefing / Workshop — shall we get a date in the diary?”

7) Engagement & Discovery Prompts (sprinkle throughout)
- Early: “Who in your team is already experimenting with AI? What’s worked/failed?”
- Mid: “Which tasks, if automated or accelerated, would free up the most time?”
- ROI: “If each of 150 users saved 20 hours/month, how would you value that time?”
- Implementation: “Who would own this internally? Who will be the champions?”

8) Objection Handling (short scripts)
- “We tried training before and adoption failed.” — “That’s why AI‑B‑C™ focuses on role‑based, hands‑on workshops, champion networks and measurable checkpoints — not one‑off theory sessions.”
- “Security/data concerns.” — “We design governance into prompts and workflows, avoid sharing PII with LLMs and can integrate with your existing data controls — we’ll show examples in the technical module.”
- “Too expensive.” — “Let’s run a quick ROI with your numbers — you’ll often see payback within months from time‑savings alone.”

9) Materials Checklist & Tech Prep
- Materials to have ready: one‑pager AI‑B‑C™ overview, ROI calculator (excel/Google sheet), 2–3 client case slides, recorded customer testimonial, role‑specific prompt templates.
- Tech checks: screen share permission, customer sample doc (for live demo), backup screenshots, test video playback, ensure presenter has local copy of deck.

10) Post‑Presentation Follow‑ups (playbook steps)
- Immediate (within 24h): Send tailored recap (selected slides, ROI snapshot, proposed next dates).
- 48–72h: Book Exec Briefing/Workshop or send deeper materials (technical appendix, sample curriculum).
- Pre‑engagement: Send short pre‑work survey to tailor focus (team size, main tools, top 3 use cases).

Use this playbook to keep presentations consistent, measurable and client‑focused. Customize slides and modules using the audience guide above; always close with a clear next step (date/cost/scope) and a commitment to build a client‑specific ROI or pilot plan during the next session.

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a slide‑by‑slide speaker script for the 90‑minute Executive Briefing.
- Build an ROI calculator template you can use live in briefings.
