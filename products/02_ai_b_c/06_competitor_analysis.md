Competitors
-----------

1) Accenture Applied Intelligence / Accenture Song
- Competitor Name & Overview  
  Accenture Applied Intelligence / Accenture Song — the AI, analytics and creative arm of a global management and technology consultancy. Offers end-to-end AI strategy, platform implementation, change management and creative marketing transformation at scale.

- Value Proposition  
  Enterprise-scale AI transformation: combines strategy, data/AI engineering and creative services to embed AI across large organisations and deliver measurable enterprise outcomes.

- Target Segment  
  Large enterprises (global, multi-market), regulated industries, CIOs/CDOs/CMOs seeking large-scale transformation and systems integration.

- Pricing Model (assumptions)  
  High-touch consultancy commercial model: multi-phase programs priced from £100k → £multi-millions; day rates for senior consultants often £1,200–£2,500/day; fixed-fee large transformation deals common. (Assumption: pricing varies by scope and region; retains premium margins.)

- Strengths (3–4)  
  1. End-to-end capability: strategy → data/engineering → implementation → change.  
  2. Scale, credibility and brand recognition with enterprise buyers.  
  3. Resource depth for global rollouts and integration with existing enterprise systems.  
  4. Access to proprietary IP, partnerships with major cloud/AI vendors.

- Weaknesses (3–4)  
  1. High cost and long procurement cycles — less attractive for fast, tactical wins.  
  2. Can be perceived as too technical or focused on platform/implementation vs. marketer-friendly adoption.  
  3. Bureaucratic and slow — less nimble for rapid test-and-learn programs.  
  4. Lower perceived authenticity in creative marketing practice relative to specialist agencies.

- Market Position  
  Premium, enterprise-grade transformation partner — “safe choice” for board-level, large-scale AI investments.

- Gap We Exploit  
  Fast, pragmatic, marketer-focused adoption programs that deliver measurable productivity in 30–90 days at a fraction of cost and time of a big consultancy. Emphasise speed, practical behaviour change and marketing ROI rather than heavy platform implementation.

2) R/GA (or equivalent global digital agency with AI services)
- Competitor Name & Overview  
  R/GA — global digital agency that blends creative, technology and product services. Offers AI-enhanced creative, marketing technology, brand experience and workforce upskilling / innovation services.

- Value Proposition  
  Combines creative excellence with technology to build brand experiences and campaigns that use AI; offers workshops and innovation sprints for brand teams.

- Target Segment  
  CMOs and marketing organisations at large consumer brands seeking creative/product differentiation and agency-led marketing transformation.

- Pricing Model (assumptions)  
  Project and retainer-based agency pricing. Creative sprints and workshops priced in low five-figures to mid-six-figures depending on scope; retainers for ongoing work. (Assumption: workshop days typically £10k–£30k depending on seniority and deliverables.)

- Strengths (3–4)  
  1. Strong creative pedigree and brand marketing credentials.  
  2. Deep experience running cross-disciplinary teams for campaign execution.  
  3. Attractive to CMOs seeking creative-led transformation.  
  4. Portfolio of high-profile clients and case studies.

- Weaknesses (3–4)  
  1. Less focused on operational upskilling and day-to-day productivity gains for employees.  
  2. Creative-first culture may under-index on measurable behaviour change and adoption metrics.  
  3. Higher cost and tendency to favour agency ownership vs. client capability-building.  
  4. Not always role-specific in training: more campaign/idea focused than process/proficiency focused.

- Market Position  
  Creative/agency leader that can apply AI to campaigns and products — attractive for brand differentiation rather than internal capability building.

- Gap We Exploit  
  Role-specific, hands-on workshops that turn marketing teams into daily AI users (not just ideation). Sell measurable productivity outcomes and internal capability rather than agency-driven execution.

3) Coursera for Business
- Competitor Name & Overview  
  Coursera for Business — enterprise learning platform offering curated, role-specific learning paths and certifications from top universities and tech companies.

- Value Proposition  
  Scalable, credentialed training for large workforces with measurable learning metrics and integrations to corporate LMSs.

- Target Segment  
  Enterprises seeking scalable enterprise-wide upskilling for large employee populations; HR/People Ops and L&D buyers.

- Pricing Model (assumptions)  
  Per-seat annual licensing + enterprise enablement fees. Typical ranges in market: $300–$1,000 per user per year depending on scale and content. (Assumption: variable by seat count and custom content.)

- Strengths (3–4)  
  1. Scalability and breadth of content from top institutions.  
  2. Recognisable certifications and structured learning paths.  
  3. Strong integrations with LMS and reporting for L&D functions.  
  4. Lower per-user cost for large rollouts.

- Weaknesses (3–4)  
  1. Passive learning model (video + assessments) — limited hands-on role-specific application for marketers.  
  2. Low guarantee of behaviour change or embedment in workflows.  
  3. Generic content not customised for client’s processes, tools or campaigns.  
  4. Longer time to see business impact; needs internal change programs to convert knowledge into use.

- Market Position  
  Scalable, cost-effective enterprise upskilling platform — attractive to L&D but less to P&L owners who care about immediate productivity gains.

- Gap We Exploit  
  Offer short, outcome-focused, hands-on programs that integrate directly into marketers’ workflows and deliver measurable time savings and ROI in 30–90 days rather than theoretical credentials.

4) General Assembly (Corporate Training)
- Competitor Name & Overview  
  General Assembly — corporate training provider focusing on skills workshops, bootcamps and custom corporate programs across topics including data, product and AI for non-technical professionals.

- Value Proposition  
  Practical, cohort-based instructor-led training focused on building usable skills quickly for teams.

  1. Generic curriculum — less focus on bespoke integration with client’s marketing tech and real work.  
  2. Outcomes often limited to knowledge uplift vs measurable productivity gains.  
  3. Not typically embedded into longer-term change programs or consultancy-led transformation.  
  4. May lack deep marketing domain expertise for large global brands.

- Market Position  
  Reliable, mid-market player for team upskilling — good for companies seeking practical workshops without bespoke consultancy costs.

- Gap We Exploit  
  Combine GA-style instructor-led delivery with brand-specific, role-specific curriculum and consultancy-grade measurement — guarantee behaviour change with direct application to real campaigns/processes.

5) Marketing AI Institute (MAI)
- Competitor Name & Overview  
  Marketing AI Institute — specialist education and advisory organisation focused on AI for marketing. Provides research, training, certification, workshops and events targeted at marketers.

- Value Proposition  
  Domain-specific expertise: helps marketing leaders understand AI use cases, vendor landscape and how to operationalise AI in marketing.

- Target Segment  
  CMOs, Head of Marketing Ops, marketing technologists at consumer brands who want marketing-specific insights and training.

- Pricing Model (assumptions)  
  Mix of free content, subscription memberships, paid workshops, and advisory projects. Workshop pricing likely mid-range (£5k–£25k) depending on customisation. (Assumption: pricing tiers exist for membership vs bespoke advisory.)

  1. Education-first — limited evidence of large-scale behaviour change or productivity guarantees.  
  2. Not typically a hands-on integrator or implementer.  
  3. Smaller delivery capacity for enterprise rollouts.  
  4. May be perceived as advisory/research rather than practical capability-builder.

- Market Position  
  Niche, authoritative specialist on marketing + AI — strong for learning and vendor guidance, weaker for operational embedding.

- Gap We Exploit  
  Deliver the specialist marketing AI content but convert it into guaranteed, measurable daily usage and productivity — tie content to real work outputs and KPIs.

Assumptions Made
----------------
- Pricing ranges are based on market norms and public signals; many enterprise deals are bespoke and negotiated, so I used conservative estimates and ranges.  
- Competitor capability descriptions are based on public positioning and typical client use-cases; specific service mixes vary by office and practice.  
- Speed-to-value claims for competitors (e.g., Coursera leads to slower behaviour change) are industry-typical observations; individual client results will vary.  
- “Workshop” price assumptions (e.g., R/GA, General Assembly, Marketing AI Institute) assume a UK/EU market context and include prep/customisation.  
- Strengths/weaknesses reflect general patterns — exceptions exist at individual consultant/agency level.

Competitive Synthesis — 3 Strategic Insights
--------------------------------------------
1) Buyers face a three-way trade-off: scale/credibility (big consultancies), creative execution (global agencies), and cost/scale (learning platforms). None combine marketing-domain credibility + fast, measurable behaviour change + mid-market pricing at scale. This is AI-B-C™’s sweet spot.

2) L&D/platform players win procurement (People/HR) and deliver scale, but they struggle to convert knowledge into daily work usage without tailored, role-specific application and change management. Enterprise consultancies can do change management but are slow and expensive. The common buyer pain: “we know we need AI, but adoption stalls.” Programs promising guaranteed week-to-week usage and measurable productivity are rare.

3) Specialist marketing AI content (MAI-like) offers trust and relevance but not execution. Creative agencies provide idea muscle but often prefer to execute themselves rather than build client capability. There’s a market opening for a vendor that sits between education and implementation: short-cycle, hands-on upskilling that directly changes day-to-day behaviour and reduces reliance on external agencies.

Our Wedge Strategy — How We Win vs This Set
---------------------------------------------
Positioning and narrative:
- Lead with outcomes and proof: “90% weekly AI use in 30 days” and “20+ hours saved per person per month” — make these measurable and demonstrable with client case studies and an ROI calculator for CMOs/CDOs.
- Market as the marketer-first, B-Corp digital consultancy that combines practical AI know-how with marketing transformation heritage and commercial ROI orientation.
- Emphasise Test-Learn-Lead™: short, low-risk sprints that scale into organisational capability avoiding heavy vendor lock-in or multi-million programs.

Tactical playbook (what to do, concretely):
1. Productise an outcome-guarantee package  
   - Standardise the Complete Sprint deliverables with KPIs (adoption %, hours saved, templates delivered) and include a simple SLA with step-down pricing/credits if targets aren’t met. That differentiates you from GA/Coursera/MAI and reduces buyer perceived risk vs. big consultancies.

2. Target P&L owners (CMOs, CDOs) not just L&D  
   - Lead with productivity & campaign throughput metrics and case studies showing revenue/efficiency impact. Use headline ROI figures (time saved × average marketer salary) to justify spend quickly.

3. Focus on marketing-specific, role-level playbooks that embed into daily tools  
   - Ship “starter kits” per role (creative, comms, media buying, product) with prompts, templates, prompt libraries, and immediate integration playbooks for common Martech stacks (Adobe, Salesforce, Google Ads). This attacks the “generic content” weakness of platforms.

4. Rapid proof points & sales motion  
   - Use the £2,000 Executive Briefing as a low-friction entry that includes a short adoption roadmap and quick-win list. Convert briefings to Team Workshop Days or Complete Sprints with a predictable playbook. Leverage client references early and run two-week pilot sprints priced aggressively relative to consultancies.

5. Strategic partnerships and channels  
   - Integrate with corporate LMSes / Coursera/Udemy as the “hands-on application layer” — offer a joint proposition where platforms deliver baseline content and AI-B-C™ provides the behaviour-change workshops and measurement. Partner with Martech vendors for co-marketing and validated tool-specific playbooks.

6. Amplify values and boutique credibility  
   - Use B-Corp messaging and Brighton boutique heritage to attract clients who care about responsible AI adoption and want a trusted partner that won’t push vendor lock-in. This also differentiates from both large consultancies and platform vendors.

Prioritised go-to-market initiatives (first 6 months)
- Publish 3 case studies that demonstrate the 30–90 day adoption and hours-saved metrics, with anonymised before/after measurements.  
- Develop an ROI calculator + one-pager tailored for CMOs/Finance that converts hours-saved into revenue/profit impact.  
- Run 12 low-cost executive briefings with target accounts (£2k offer) and convert at least 25% into Team Workshop or Complete Sprint within 90 days.  
- Build role-specific starter kits (Creative, Media, CRM) and a short integration checklist for 5 common Martech platforms.  
- Co-sell pilots with 2 LMS/platform partners to access L&D budgets while staying the outcome-focused execution partner.

Closing / One-line strategic claim to use in sales collateral
- “The marketer-first AI adoption program that turns your team into AI power users in 90 days — measurable productivity, real work outputs, no vendor lock-in.”

If you want, I can:
- Draft the ROI calculator (spreadsheet) tied to your claimed “20+ hours per month” metric tailored by role and country cost rates.  
- Create 2–3 battlecards tailored for sales: “Against Accenture”, “Against Coursera”, “Against R/GA” with one-liners, rebuttals and win themes per buyer persona.  
- Produce a one-page pilot offer (for the £2,000 Executive Briefing) designed to convert to Complete Sprint.

Which of those would be most useful next?
