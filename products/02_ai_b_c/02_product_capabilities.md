# AI-B-C™ • Product Capabilities

Summary: concise, sales-ready definition of AI-B-C™ core capabilities, how we deliver value in practice, where it plugs into client systems and processes, and the near-term capability roadmap — all framed for conversations with CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors and C-suite buyers.

1) Primary Capabilities (3–5) — what AI-B-C™ does and the business benefit
- Rapid enterprise upskilling that delivers behaviour change
  - What: Turns teams into practical AI power users via executive briefings, role-based workshops and on-the-job learning.
  - Business benefit: 90% of participants using AI weekly within 30 days — faster time-to-value, reduced project friction and immediate uplift in campaign velocity and decision-making.
- Productivity multiplier for routine and repetitive work
  - What: Teaches staff to use AI to automate drafting, research, data summarisation and repetitive creative tasks through prompts, templates and workflows.
  - Business benefit: Typical saving of 20+ hours per person per month — lower operating cost, faster campaign cycles, and redirected capacity to higher-value strategic work.
- Role-specific application to drive measurable KPIs
  - What: Tailored learning paths and use-cases for marketing, product, insight, creative and comms teams (not generic theory).
  - Business benefit: Direct impact on KPIs (faster time-to-market, improved campaign ROI, higher lead velocity) because training is applied to each team’s everyday work.
- Scalable, safe adoption with governance and embedment
  - What: Practical playbooks, guardrails, and progress tracking for secure, compliant roll-out across teams.
  - Business benefit: Minimises risk (data, brand, regulatory) while enabling predictable, repeatable adoption that scales across the organisation.

2) Delivery Method — how it works in practice (for sales conversations)
- 3-stage customer journey (fast, measurable, repeatable)
  1. Align (Executive Briefing — 90 minutes, £2,000)
     - Outcome: Leadership alignment on strategy, priorities and sponsorship; agree success metrics and timeline.
  2. Activate (Team Workshop Day — £8,800 per team)
     - Outcome: Role-specific, hands-on workshops using live client scenarios; participants leave with working templates, prompts and immediate tasks to apply that week.
  3. Embed (Complete Sprint Package — £17,500)
     - Outcome: Executive brief + two team workshops + follow-up coaching, progress tracking and success measurement across 90 days.
- Practical mechanics
  - Custom discovery up-front to map 3–5 priority use-cases tied to business metrics.
  - Modular curriculum delivered in short, work-focused sessions that fit team rhythms.
  - Real-work assignments during workshops so outputs are production-ready (campaign briefs, content, reports).
  - Post-workshop coaching, prompt libraries, templates and a simple success dashboard to quantify adoption and hours saved.
- Expected outcomes & timelines
  - 30 days: 90% weekly usage milestone for participants.
  - 90 days: measurable productivity gains (20+ hours/person/month) and first business-level improvements (faster launches, better insight cycles).

Suggested follow-up materials to advance a sales opportunity
- One-page capability brief (this doc as a single-sided sell sheet).
- Example sprint agenda + participant outcomes.
- Case study or anonymised mini-case (e.g., time-savings and campaign speed improvements).
- Executive briefing slide pack and ROI snapshot.

Use these points to lead buyer conversations — open with business pain (stalled adoption, wasted time, lost agility), show how AI-B-C™ converts interest into immediate, measurable business outcomes, and close on a low-risk pilot (Executive Briefing or Team Workshop) tied to a clear 30/90-day success metric.
