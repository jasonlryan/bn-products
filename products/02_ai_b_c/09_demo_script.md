Hook (10s)
(0:00–0:10) Presenter: "Imagine every marketer, analyst and product owner in your business saving 20+ hours a month — not someday, but within 90 days. That’s AI-B-C™. Quick demo starts now."

Context (20s)
(0:10–0:30) Presenter: "We’re Brilliant Noise — a Brighton-based, B‑Corp digital consultancy. Since 2009 we’ve helped global brands like adidas and BMW transform marketing. AI-B-C™ is our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ programme that turns teams into practical AI power users — fast, safe and measurable."

Live Flow — 6 steps with spoken cues (72s)
(0:30–1:42) Presenter: "Here’s how a typical session feels — six live steps, real words your team will use."

Step 1 — Executive Alignment (12s)
(0:30–0:42) Cue: "Executive brief: ‘Summarise our current martech spend and three opportunity areas for AI.’" Outcome: "A focused roadmap and KPIs we agree on in 90 minutes."

Step 2 — Role-specific onboarding (12s)
(0:42–0:54) Cue: "Marketer prompt: ‘Draft four campaign hooks for product X, tone: premium, 25–35 demographic.’" Outcome: "Templates and prompts tailored to each role."

Step 3 — Hands‑on workshop (12s)
(0:54–1:06) Cue: "Workshop lead: ‘Use AI to turn this brief into a content calendar for Q3 — 8 posts, 2 emails, 1 landing page.’" Outcome: "Working artefacts by lunch."

Step 4 — Process integration (12s)
(1:06–1:18) Cue: "Ops prompt: ‘Generate SOP for AI-assisted copy reviews with version control.’" Outcome: "Repeatable processes that embed AI into daily workflows."

Step 5 — Measurement & tracking (12s)
(1:18–1:30) Cue: "Analyst: ‘Create a dashboard spec to track weekly AI usage and time saved per person.’" Outcome: "Clear metrics: usage, hours saved, ROI."

Step 6 — Follow-up & scale (12s)
(1:30–1:42) Cue: "Coach: ‘Recommend next 30-day learning sprints based on these team gaps.’" Outcome: "A 90‑day roll‑out plan with coaching and governance."

Wow Moment (10s)
(1:42–1:52) Presenter: "One line: 90% of your team using AI weekly within 30 days — and 20+ hours saved per person per month. That’s adoption you can measure."

Objection Handling — 2 quick counters (16s)
(1:52–2:08) Objection 1 (8s): "‘We’ve run pilots and nothing changed.’" Counter: "Pilots fail when they’re generic; we build role-first prompts, SOPs and KPIs so behaviour actually changes."
(2:00–2:08) Objection 2 (8s): "‘We’re worried about data and IP.’" Counter: "We train secure prompting, integrate your governance, and partner with IT so IP never leaves your controls."
