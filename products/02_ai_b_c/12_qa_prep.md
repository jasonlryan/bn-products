# AI-B-C™ • Qa Prep

1) What is your Total Addressable Market and which segment are you targeting first?
Answer: We target the global enterprise marketing and product teams within mid-to-large consumer brands (150–50,000 employees), a subset of the enterprise L&D and digital transformation market worth multi-billions and growing rapidly as AI adoption accelerates.  
Follow-up: I’ll send our TAM deck and ICP prioritisation slides for your review.

2) How do you differentiate from McKinsey/BCG, big agencies and pure tech implementers?
Answer: We combine hands-on AI upskilling, marketing transformation pedigree and boutique agility—practical, role-specific training that delivers measurable productivity (90% weekly use in 30 days, 20+ hrs saved/month) rather than strategy alone or pure tooling.  
Follow-up: See our competitor matrix and three recent client case studies showing comparative outcomes.

3) What is your business model and primary revenue streams?
Answer: We sell tiered, outcome-focused programs—Executive Briefings (£2k), Team Workshop Days (£8.8k) and Complete Sprints (£17.5k)—with follow-on retainers for implementation and capability support.  
Follow-up: I can share our pricing catalogue and example engagement revenue map.

4) Can this product scale beyond one-off workshops—what’s the path to recurring revenue and productisation?
Answer: Yes; we scale via modular curricula, train-the-trainer and subscription success plans that convert one-off workshops into ongoing capability contracts and platformised assets for repeatable delivery.  
Follow-up: Let me show you our subscription roadmap and pilot-to-retainer conversion metrics.

5) What are your unit economics — CAC, LTV and payback period?
Answer: Our model is services-led with strong repeat rates and favourable LTV/CAC driven by enterprise renewals and cross-sell, delivering payback within a single annual contract cycle for most deals.  
Follow-up: I’ll share the anonymised cohort LTV/CAC and payback schedule from our CRM.

6) What gross margins do engagements deliver and where are the capacity constraints?
Answer: Workshops and sprints deliver healthy professional-services gross margins (highly variable by mix), with the primary capacity constraint being senior trainer time which we manage via standardised modules and accredited partners.  
Follow-up: I can provide margin models by engagement type and our capacity/partner plan.

7) Tell us about the founding and delivery team — do you have enterprise credibility and execution depth?
Answer: Founders have 15+ years in digital transformation and a track record with global brands (adidas, BMW, Nestlé), supported by a senior delivery team of AI practitioners and experienced marketing strategists.  
Follow-up: Request bios and three client references and we’ll send them over.

8) How will you recruit and scale trainers while preserving quality and brand reputation?
Answer: We use a phased hiring and accreditation approach—hire senior leads, standardise content, certify internal trainers and trusted partners, and enforce quality via live audits and client KPIs.  
Follow-up: I can share our trainer accreditation playbook and QA checklist.

9) What is your go-to-market motion and typical enterprise sales cycle?
Answer: GTM combines direct enterprise sales to CMOs/CDOs, partner referrals from agencies/tech vendors, and targetted executive briefings; average sales cycles are 6–12 weeks for pilot workshops and 3–6 months for large sprints.  
Follow-up: I’ll send the GTM funnel metrics and a sample pipeline of active opportunities.

10) What are the biggest execution risks and how do you mitigate them?
Answer: Top risks are delivery scalability, client outcome variability and fast-moving competition; we mitigate via standardised curricula, outcome SLAs, client success metrics and continuous product iteration from our Test-Learn-Lead™ process.  
Follow-up: See our risk register and mitigation roadmap—I’ll share the latest version.

11) How defensible is your IP—do you have proprietary content, methods, or tech?
Answer: Our defensibility is built on a proprietary curriculum, role-specific playbooks, client-tested workflows and B2B relationships rather than patents, making it hard-to-copy in practice though not fully patentable.  
Follow-up: I can provide anonymised curriculum samples and explain our client lock-in mechanisms.

12) How do you handle client data, privacy and compliance for enterprise customers?
Answer: We operate strict data-handling protocols, use secure tooling, sign enterprise NDAs, and advise clients on privacy-by-design and vendor configurations to ensure GDPR and sector-specific compliance.  
Follow-up: I’ll share our data-processing addendum, security checklist and SOC/ISO evidence where available.
