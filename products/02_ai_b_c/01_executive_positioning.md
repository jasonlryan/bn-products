# AI-B-Câ„¢ â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Enterprise marketing and product teams know AI can improve performance but adoption stalls: pilots, tool fragmentation, and lack of role-specific training leave most employees unable to use AI for everyday work. That gap wastes time, reduces competitive agility, and prevents measurable productivity gains from reaching the bottom line.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- A priced, modular program (Executive Briefing Â£2,000; Team Workshop Day Â£8,800; Complete Sprint Â£17,500) that combines executive alignment, role-specific workshops and ongoing support to move teams from curiosity to daily use.  
- 90-day transformation pathway that delivers 90% of participants using AI weekly within 30 days and builds AI power users across teams in 90 days.  
- Hands-on, work-backed curriculum and progress tracking (real work scenarios, role learning paths, and measurable dashboards) designed to deliver the advertised 20+ hours saved per person per month.  
- Delivered through our Test-Learn-Leadâ„¢ methodology and Bâ€‘Corp values: rapid pilots, measurable learning loops, and practical governance to embed tools into real workflows without heavy vendor lock-in.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
In a workshop a content director hands over a twoâ€‘hour reporting task to a team member who, using a roleâ€‘specific AI workflow built that same day, finishes it in 10 minutes and sees a projected 20+ hour/month saving appear on the team dashboard.

## Audience
- CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors and other Câ€‘suite execs responsible for marketing or digital transformation  
- Medium and large enterprises (50+ employees, ideal 150+ employees) where AI adoption has stalled or never started  
- Cross-functional teams (marketing, product, insights, operations) that need role-specific, practical AI capability  
- Organisations with employee development budgets looking for measurable productivity and retention gains

## Why We're Excited
As founders of Brilliant Noise weâ€™ve worked with adidas, BMW and NestlÃ© and seen strategy fail at execution when teams donâ€™t adopt new ways of working. AIâ€‘Bâ€‘Câ„¢ matters because it converts enterprise AI strategy into daily practiceâ€”measurable hours saved, clearer performance uplift and retained talentâ€”at a price point and speed that lets organisations act before competitors do. Itâ€™s our Testâ€‘Learnâ€‘Leadâ„¢ approach applied to capability, not just technology: rapid pilots, role-specific skill building and governance that reflects our Bâ€‘Corp commitments to ethical, equitable upskilling.

## Positioning Statement
AIâ€‘Bâ€‘Câ„¢ is the Brightonâ€‘based Bâ€‘Corp programme that turns enterprise teams into practical AI power users in 90 daysâ€”measurable weekly adoption and 20+ hour/month productivity gainsâ€”delivered via Testâ€‘Learnâ€‘Leadâ„¢ for CMOs and CDOs who want real marketing transformation, not consultancy theory.
