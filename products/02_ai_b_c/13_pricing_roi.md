# AI-B-C™ • Pricing Roi

Business Model Canvas (condensed)
- Key Partners: LMS & LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic), HR/L&D buyers, channel partners (regional consultancies), enterprise sales agencies.
- Key Activities: executive briefings, team workshops, 90‑day sprints, content creation, customer success & measurement.
- Key Resources: senior AI consultants, facilitators, modular curriculum, analytics dashboard, B‑Corp brand.
- Cost Structure: direct delivery costs (consultants, travel, licences), content amortisation, sales & marketing, platform & overhead.
- Revenue Streams: one‑off training fees (Exec £2k, Workshop £8.8k, Sprint £17.5k), recurring support/subscription, premium custom projects, licensing.

Unit Economics (assumptions shown)
Assumptions: senior consultant fully‑loaded £120/hr; junior facilitator £60/hr; travel/materials/platform amortised per engagement.

1) Exec Briefing (90 mins) — Price £2,000
- Direct cost: prep (4h senior) £480 + delivery (1.5h senior) £180 + admin £50 + travel/materials £240 = £950
- Gross margin: £1,050 (53%)

2) Team Workshop Day — Price £8,800
- Direct cost: prep (8h senior + 8h junior) £1,440 + delivery (8h senior+8h junior) £1,440 + travel £300 + materials/platform £350 = £3,530
- Gross margin: £5,270 (60%)

3) Complete Sprint — Price £17,500
- Direct cost: exec + 2 workshops + 30‑day support + content amortisation ≈ £11,110
- Gross margin: £6,390 (37%)

Breakeven (monthly)
- Fixed costs (allocated to product): 2 FTEs (£16k), marketing £4k, platform £1k = £21k/month.
- Using a representative monthly mix (1 Sprint, 2 Workshops, 2 Execs): contribution ≈ £19k on revenue £39.1k — short of fixed costs.
- Target monthly revenue to break even ≈ £43–45k (roughly one Sprint + 2 Workshops + 3 Execs). Action: aim for £540k ARR to cover current headcount and growth.

Pricing Strategy
- Model & justification: value‑based tiering — low‑friction Exec (£2k) to openthe door; Workshops (£8.8k) for team transformation; Sprint (£17.5k) as value bundle. Prices align to delivered ROI (see ROI section) and boutique premium positioning.
- Competitive positioning: premium boutique vs large consultancies — charge 25–40% below top consultancies but above mass e‑learning; emphasise bespoke facilitation, measurable productivity gains, B‑Corp values.
- Price testing framework: run cohort A/B tests on discount (10% vs 0%) to measure conversion lift; pilot “value‑share” offer (reduced upfront, bonus on realised savings) for 5 clients; track CAC payback, NPS, time‑to‑value. Use landing page price experiments and win/loss interviews.

Scalability Analysis
- Constraints: senior facilitator capacity, customisation time, travel, sales cycle.
- Path to scale: productise modules (off‑the‑shelf playbooks), build digital self‑serve course for 70% of content, create Train‑the‑Trainer (TtT) programme to scale reach, license curriculum to HR partners.
- Automation opportunities: onboarding bots, automated skills assessments, analytics dashboards for ROI tracking, templated prompts and role‑specific libraries to reduce prep from hours to minutes.

ROI Framework (customer perspective — training 30 people)
Assumptions vary by scenario: per‑person hourly value and hours saved.

1) Conservative
- 10 hrs saved/month; £35/hr => £350/month/person → 30 people = £10,500/month (£126k/year)
- Payback on Sprint (£17.5k): 1.7 months

2) Base
- 20 hrs saved/month; £45/hr => £900/month/person → 30 people = £27,000/month (£324k/year)
- Payback: 0.65 months

3) Aggressive
- 30 hrs saved/month; £60/hr => £1,800/month/person → 30 people = £54,000/month (£648k/year)
- Payback: 0.32 months

Value metrics to track: hours saved per role, % of team weekly AI use, time‑to‑first‑impact, cost per hour saved.

Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell opportunities: 1) Managed prompt engineering & tool integrations (£3k–£10k/month), 2) Custom LLM fine‑tuning / governance projects (£30k+), 3) Subscription access to prompts + analytics (£50–200/user/year), 4) TtT licensing to internal L&D.
- Recurring potential: convert 30–40% of Sprint clients to support subscription (£6–12k/year avg).
- CLTV example: initial Sprint £17.5k + avg recurring £12k/year over 2 years = £41.5k. Subtract CAC (~£6k) → net CLTV ≈ £35.5k.
Actionable insights
- Promote Sprint as primary land-and-expand product; use Exec Briefings as low‑cost lead generator.
- Rapidly productise 40% of content into digital modules to increase capacity 3x and improve margins.
- Package a 12‑month subscription (support + analytics + 2 refresher workshops) to turn one‑offs into predictable ARR.
