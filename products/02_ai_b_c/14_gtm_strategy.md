# AI-B-C™ • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — AI‑B‑C™ (Brilliant Noise)

Purpose: Practical, time‑bound playbook to take AI‑B‑C™ from boutique product offering to a scalable, repeatable revenue engine while protecting quality, B‑Corp values and Brilliant Noise’s market positioning.

Assumptions (use to sanity‑check capacity targets; revise with real headcount/bench data)
- Current core AI‑B‑C delivery team: ~6 people (1 Programme Lead, 2 Senior Facilitators, 1 Learning Designer, 1 AI Engineer, 1 Customer Success/PM). Adjust if different.
- Current baseline monthly delivery capacity (conservative boutique pace):
  - Complete Sprint: 2 / month (24 / year) @ £17,500 = £420k
  - Team Workshop Days: 4 / month (48 / year) @ £8,800 = £422k
  - Executive Briefings: 8 / month (96 / year) @ £2,000 = £192k
  - Baseline annual revenue (AI‑B‑C products) ≈ £1.03M
- Target: 10x revenue ≈ £10M+ ARR from AI‑B‑C portfolio within 36 months.
- Enterprise sales cycle: 8–14 weeks average. Conversion benchmarks to model (adjust to real data): briefing → workshop conversion 30%, qualified lead → Complete Sprint 10–20%.

SECTION 1 — Channel Strategy (Primary and Secondary)
Goal: Maximise high‑value enterprise deals, build consistent lead flow and partner distribution for scale.

Primary channels (focus, highest ROI for enterprise targets)
1. Direct Enterprise Sales (ABM & outbound)
   - Rationale: Buyers are CMOs/CDOs/Innovation leaders; need relationship selling and consultative demos.
   - Activities: Targeted outbound, executive briefings as pricing entry point, tailored ABM content.
2. Strategic Partnerships (co‑selling with HR/L&D vendors, systems integrators, boutique consultancies)
   - Rationale: Faster access to larger client pools, scalability via partner delivery (train‑the‑trainer/resell).
3. Content & Thought Leadership (LinkedIn, long‑form case studies, executive webinars/roundtables)
   - Rationale: Builds credibility, leads for briefings and workshops, aligns with C‑suite consumption habits.

Secondary channels (support scale, lower CAC)
4. Channel Aggregators / Learning Marketplaces (LMS marketplaces, corporate training platforms)
   - Rationale: Volume licensing, seat sales, passive revenue once content packaged.
5. Event Partnerships & Conferences (sponsor CMO/innovation events)
   - Rationale: Brand awareness, pipeline acceleration.
6. Referral Network (agencies, alumni, client champions)
   - Rationale: Lower CAC, high trust conversion.

Action items (30/60/90)
- 0–30d: Build ABM ICP lists (top 150 targets) + outreach templates.
- 30–90d: Engage 5 prospective partners; draft partner commercial terms (referral %, co‑sell splits).
- 90–180d: List target marketplaces (LMS), scope packaging requirements.

   - Duration: 1–2 weeks
   - Deliverables: stakeholder map, current state AI adoption audit, success metrics.
2. Sprint planning & pre‑work

Quality control & governance
- Standardised playbooks & templates (single source of truth in Notion or Confluence).
- Facilitator certification program (internal: bronze/silver/gold tiers).
- Pre‑delivery checklists & client sign‑off gates.

SECTION 6 — Sales Process (qualification, conversion, onboarding)
Sales motion: Consultancy‑led, outcomes‑focused.

Qualification framework (modified BANT)
- Budget: Is there training / transformation budget? (HR / L&D often a fund source)
- Authority: CMO / CDO / Head of Innovation engaged? Executive sponsor identified?
- Need: Adoption stalled? KPI tied to productivity or revenue?
- Timing: Are they looking to act in 30/60/90 days?
- Impact: Estimated people affected (# seats) × expected hours saved → clear £ impact.

Sales stages & activity
1. Engage (inbound briefing / outbound intro)
   - Asset: executive briefing offer.
   - KPI: booking rate.
2. Discover (scoped discovery call + pre‑work)
   - Deliverable: scope doc + success metrics.
