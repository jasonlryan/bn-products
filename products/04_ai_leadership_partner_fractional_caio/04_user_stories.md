# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • User Stories

Persona: Chief Marketing Officer (Enterprise CPG)
Journey stage: Discovery

User Story:
As a CMO, I want a clear, quantified business case for AI investment, so that I can secure board approval for a programme with an expected marketing-attributed ROI (revenue uplift or cost reduction) within 12 months.

Acceptance Criteria (define “done”):
- A one-page executive summary and 10–12 slide business case are delivered, including baseline metrics and three scenario projections (conservative, expected, aggressive) with quantified KPIs and timelines.
- Financial projection shows expected payback within 12 months or clearly explains why a longer horizon is required; assumptions are traceable to data sources.
- At least three executive stakeholders (e.g., CFO, CEO, Head of Sales) have reviewed and signed off the business case.
- The board-approved budget and next-step decision (pilot or programme) are documented.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Enables the CMO to unlock budget and remove executive uncertainty, accelerating time-to-value and reducing the likelihood of underfunded or abandoned AI pilots.

Persona: Chief Marketing Officer (Enterprise CPG)
Journey stage: Evaluation

- Data readiness assessment completed and any required data access or integrations confirmed in writing.
- Pilot run is executed and a post-pilot report delivered showing actual KPI delta, statistical confidence, learned risks, and a recommendation to scale or stop.
- Steering committee decision recorded within two weeks of pilot close.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: De-risks investment decisions, proves business value early, and provides evidence to scale only what delivers measurable returns.

Persona: Chief Data Officer (Enterprise)
Journey stage: Evaluation

User Story:
As a CDO, I want an independent AI maturity and risk assessment, so that I can prioritise remediation and reduce model failure and operational risk by a measurable amount within six months.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A maturity assessment report is delivered covering governance, data readiness, model lifecycle, tooling, and skills, with a scored maturity level.
- A risk heatmap identifies top 5 risks with Likelihood x Impact ratings and remediation prioritised by expected risk reduction.
- A remediation roadmap with owners, timelines and measurable success criteria (e.g., test coverage %, model monitoring in place) is agreed.
- CDO and two senior stakeholders approve the assessment and roadmap.

Priority: Must Have

Persona: Chief Data Officer (Enterprise)
Journey stage: Purchase

User Story:
As a CDO, I want a clear engagement model and transparent cost/benefit comparison versus hiring a full-time CAIO, so that I can justify selecting the fractional CAIO and demonstrate at least a 50% cost saving and faster time-to-value to finance.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A written engagement proposal shows scope, hours, SLAs, deliverables and an annualised cost compare (fractional vs full-time hire) using agreed assumptions.
- A quantified cost-benefit summary projects time-to-value (e.g., first measurable KPI improvement) and estimated cost savings (>=50%) and avoided waste (e.g., reduction in likely failed projects).
- Finance and procurement confirm procurement route and approve the proposal for signature.
- Contractual start date and first 90-day milestones are agreed.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Gives the CDO the financial justification to procure senior AI leadership quickly and economically, reducing hiring risk and accelerating strategic decisions.

- All key stakeholder introductions and access to required data/environment are completed within the first two weeks.
- The fractional CAIO delivers the three primary deliverables by day 90 and they are accepted by the CDO and two exec stakeholders.

Persona: Head of Innovation (Scale-up)
Journey stage: Success / Capability Building

User Story:

Acceptance Criteria:
- A baseline skills assessment is completed and a 6–12 month training curriculum is agreed with measurable learning outcomes.
- At least three training modules (e.g., AI strategy for PMs, model life-cycle basics for engineers, responsible AI for all teams) are delivered and assessed.
- Measurable indicator of capability shift is tracked (e.g., proportion of tasks executed in-house vs externally) and shows target reduction (50%) at 12 months.
- Post-training, product teams can independently run at least one iteration cycle on an AI feature with coaching reduced to advisory mode.

Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Builds internal capability, lowers long-term external spend, and increases speed of iteration and innovation resilience.

Notes:
- Stories are grouped by persona and journey stage to align with buyer decision-making. Numbers (%, months) are provided to make outcomes measurable — adjust targets in each organisation’s context during scoping.
- If you’d like, I can convert these into a prioritised backlog, map them to acceptance-test templates, or translate them into sales/ops checklists for client engagements.
