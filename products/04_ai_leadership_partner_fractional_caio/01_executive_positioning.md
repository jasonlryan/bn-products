# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Senior AI leadership is prohibitively expensive and scarceâ€”hiring a CAIO typically costs Â£200K+ and organisations without that expertise make implementation errors that commonly waste Â£150K+. As a result, CMOs, CDOs and executive teams stall highâ€‘value AI decisions or fund pointless pilots that never scale.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- Offer a Fractional CAIO â€” AI Leadership Partner â€” from Â£8,000/month delivering on-demand executive AI strategy, decision-making and governance as a lowerâ€‘risk alternative to a fullâ€‘time Â£200K+ hire.  
- Run our Testâ€‘Learnâ€‘Leadâ„¢ process to prioritise and deâ€‘risk initiatives with short experiments, measurable KPIs and a pragmatic roadmap that shows quick wins and scalable bets within defined budgets.  
- Provide executive coaching, board-level briefings and decision frameworks that prevent common Â£150K+ implementation mistakes and ensure compliant, ethical deployment aligned to Bâ€‘Corp values.  
- Build client capability through skills assessments, role definitions, team development plans and recruitment support so organisations can graduate from fractional leadership to sustainable internal capability.  
- Leverage our Brighton boutique experience and 15+ years of marketing transformation to marry commercial performance with practical AI application for global brands.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
When the first Testâ€‘Learnâ€‘Leadâ„¢ experiment delivers a tracked revenue or efficiency uplift and the board accepts a clear, governed roadmap, executives stop debating AI as a risk and start treating it as a measured competitive lever.

## Audience
