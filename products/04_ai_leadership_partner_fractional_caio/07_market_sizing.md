# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Market Sizing

Below is a compact, reproducible TAM analysis for AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO). I show two estimation approaches (Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up), list all key assumptions and formulas, give TAM / SAM / SOM values (base case + sensitivity), and finish with three concrete go‑to‑market implications.

Summary (quick)
- Base-case TAM (addressable annual revenue if every qualified enterprise bought a Fractional CAIO): ~£6.0B / year.
- Serviceable Available Market (SAM — those likely to buy in the near term ≈ next 1–3 years): ~£1.2B / year.
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM — realistic share Brilliant Noise could capture in a few years): ~£12M / year (base case, 1% of SAM).
- Sensitivity (±20% on the key inputs) gives TAM range ~£3.8B – £8.6B, SAM ~£0.61B – £2.07B, SOM ~£4.9M – £24.9M.

I. Definitions and formulas
- TAM (top-level): TAM = Number_of_target_organisations × Average_annual_price_per_client
- SAM (near-term demand): SAM = Number_of_target_organisations × Adoption_rate × Average_annual_price
- SOM (what Brilliant Noise can realistically win): SOM = SAM × Market_share_for_BN

II. Market frame and reasoning (primary market)
- Primary market = large enterprises and well‑funded scale‑ups that (a) view AI as strategic imperative and (b) can afford senior AI advisory (target buyer ICPs: CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors, C-suite). Practically: organisations roughly revenue ≥ £250M or employee count in the several-hundreds+ range in developed markets (UK, US, EU, APAC developed markets, Australia, Canada). This is consistent with client list (adidas, BMW, Nestlé, etc.).
- Why this frame: Fractional CAIO is priced at a level that only makes sense for organisations that have material AI opportunity/risk (not SMBs). The product replaces/augments senior hires and therefore addresses enterprises that would otherwise hire a full-time CAIO or buy senior advisory.

III. Key assumptions (explicit)
- Number of target organisations (N): Base = 50,000 globally (developed-market enterprises and scale-ups). This breaks down by rough regional guess: US ~20k, EU ~15k, APAC developed + Australia ~8k, UK ~3k, Rest ~4k → total ≈50k. (Explicit: this is a best‑guess derived from known large‑firm counts; you can tighten with Firmographic data from Orbis/D&B/World Bank.)
- Average annual price / ARR per client (P): Base = £120,000 / year (blended; product “from £8k/month” → £96k/year floor; many clients will buy broader packages; I assume an average retained engagement lands at ~£120k).
- Adoption rate (A) for SAM: Base = 20% of target organisations will actively hire or contract Fractional CAIO services in the next 1–3 years (these are orgs with budget, executive buy‑in, and a near‑term AI agenda).
- Initial realistic market share for Brilliant Noise (M): Base = 1% of SAM in the medium term (3 years). Boutique global specialist with prior brand clients can reach 0.5–2% depending on ramp and partnerships.

IV. Bottom‑Up calculation (primary, most actionable)
Formulas:
- TAM_bottomup = N × P
- SAM_bottomup = N × A × P
- SOM_bottomup = SAM_bottomup × M

Plugging in base numbers:
- N = 50,000
- P = £120,000
- A = 20% (0.20)
- M = 1% (0.01)

Calculations:
- TAM = 50,000 × £120,000 = £6,000,000,000 (£6.0B / year)
- SAM = 50,000 × 0.20 × £120,000 = 10,000 × £120,000 = £1,200,000,000 (£1.2B / year)
- SOM = £1,200,000,000 × 0.01 = £12,000,000 (£12M / year)

Notes on bottom‑up logic:
- The Bottom‑Up approach is simply “how many target companies × what they’d pay” and is directly tied to your pricing and ICP definition — it’s the most actionable for capacity and sales planning.
- With a price floor of £96k (8k/mo), the TAM floor (if P=£96k) would be 50k×£96k = £4.8B; with premium upsells (P = £200k) TAM could be much higher.

V. Top‑Down approach (market‑share / category sizing)
Top‑Down options (two ways to apply):
A) From AI consulting/advisory market
- Take an estimate for the global AI consulting/advisory market (examples from industry reports vary — but global AI services & advisory is in the multi‑billion to tens‑of‑billions GBP range).
- Assume leadership/advisory (senior strategy & governance) is some % of that market (e.g., 5–15% depending on segmentation).
- Example (illustrative only): If global AI consulting = £40B, and leadership/advisory slice = 10% → TAM = £4B. If you assume a broader AI leadership & change advisory slice = 15% → TAM = £6B. This aligns with the bottom‑up £6B figure.

B) From management consulting market
- Global management consulting market ≈ hundreds of billions USD/GBP (estimates vary by source). Fractional senior leadership/advisory (CAIO roles) would be a small fraction (0.5–3%) of that total.
- For instance, if consulting market = £300B and your segment = 2% → TAM = £6B.

Top‑Down conclusion:
- Depending on assumptions (which I list), the top‑down approach produces a TAM in the low single-digit billions to high single-digit billions of GBP — consistent with the bottom‑up £6B base.

VI. Sensitivity (±20% on the key inputs)
We vary three key inputs by ±20%: N (number target orgs), P (avg price), A (adoption rate). For SOM I also vary BN market share ±20% around 1%.

Scenarios and results (rounded):

- Low case (−20% N, −20% P, −20% A):
  - N = 40,000; P = £96,000; A = 16% → TAM = 40,000×96k = £3,840M (£3.84B)
  - SAM = 40,000×0.16×96k = 6,400×96k = £614.4M
  - SOM (BN share 0.8%) = £614.4M×0.008 = £4.915M

- Base case:
  - N = 50,000; P = £120,000; A = 20% → TAM = £6,000M (£6.0B)
  - SAM = £1,200M (£1.2B)
  - SOM (BN share 1%) = £12.0M

- High case (+20% N, +20% P, +20% A):
  - N = 60,000; P = £144,000; A = 24% → TAM = 60,000×144k = £8,640M (£8.64B)
  - SAM = 60,000×0.24×144k = 14,400×144k = £2,073.6M (~£2.07B)
  - SOM (BN share 1.2%) = £2,073.6M×0.012 = £24.883M (~£24.9M)

(Summary table)
- TAM range ≈ £3.8B – £8.6B
- SAM range ≈ £0.61B – £2.07B
- SOM range ≈ £4.9M – £24.9M

VII. Sources / best‑guess logic and caveats
- Where precise counts of target enterprises are not available in public datasets in a clean form, I used conservative, industry‑typical firm counts (e.g., number of companies with hundreds+ employees across US/EU/UK/APAC) and rounded to 50k for the global developed‑market target — this approach is standard for early TAM work and should be refined by linking to firmographic datasets (D&B Hoovers, Orbis, Bureau van Dijk, national business registers).
- Pricing is explicit: “from £8k/month” → annual floor £96k. I assumed a blended average higher than the floor due to upsells, multi‑month engagements, and packages including coaching, roadmaps and recruitment support.
- Adoption rate (20%) is a judgement: many large organisations are actively investing in AI leadership; still adoption is constrained by budget cycles and readiness.
- Top‑down numbers referencing “global AI consulting” or “management consulting” are intentionally directional — use these to sanity‑check the bottom‑up result rather than as hard inputs.
- Recommendation: validate N and P using CRM data, sector firmographics, and a pricing test with current prospects to tighten numbers.

VIII. Three go‑to‑market implications (practical)
1) Focused ICP targeting + enterprise depth: Given TAM concentration among large enterprises, invest in a narrow vertical/wedge strategy (e.g., CPG, automotive, retail) where Brilliant Noise already has marquee clients (adidas, BMW, Nestlé). Converting a few marquee reference deals will accelerate acquisition in that vertical and justify higher ARR (increasing P improves TAM capture).
2) Productize tiered packages to increase win rate and ARR: Offer clear tiers (Foundational Fractional CAIO at £96k/yr; Strategic Fractional CAIO at £120–180k/yr; Enterprise Partnership at £200k+/yr). Productization reduces sales friction for buyers and helps scale delivery (and margin). Free/brokered pilot packages (3 months) can convert budget‑conscious buyers into multi‑quarter retainers.
3) Build partnerships & delivery leverage to grow SOM: With a plausible medium‑term SOM of ~1%, to materially grow beyond that you’ll need (a) referral/reseller partnerships with consultancies/system integrators, (b) a repeatable playbook and scalable delivery (templates, playbooks, fractional CAIO bench), and (c) targeted thought leadership aimed at CMOs/CDOs. This reduces cost to acquire and increases capacity so you can safely scale to the £10–25M SOM range shown in the high‑case scenario.

IX. Next steps (recommended for tighter estimates)
- Pull exact counts for target firms from D&B / Orbis for your chosen geographies and revenue/employee thresholds.
- Run a pricing experiment on 10–20 target prospects to validate blended ARR (P).
- Use existing CRM/opportunity pipeline to estimate a more precise adoption/conversion funnel that maps to SAM→SOM forecasts.

If you want, I can:
- Re-run this with a configurable spreadsheet (you provide the firmographic counts or I pull public estimates) so you can toggle N, P, A and M; or
- Build a 3‑year revenue ramp (headcount and delivery capacity) for Brilliant Noise based on the SOM scenarios.
