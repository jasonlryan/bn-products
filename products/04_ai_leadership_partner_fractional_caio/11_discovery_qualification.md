# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Discovery Qualification

Below is a practical, sales-ready discovery & qualification framework tailored for Brilliant Noise’s AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO). Use this in discovery calls, qualification scoring, and next-step decisioning to accelerate deals with CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors and exec teams at large enterprises and scale-ups.

Sections
1) Ten discovery questions (mapped to BANT + MEDDIC)  
2) Red-flag disqualification indicators  
3) Ideal-customer scoring (1–10 per criterion) with weights and rubrics  
4) Prescribed next steps by qualification band (high / medium / low)

1) Ten discovery questions (BANT + MEDDIC mapping)
Instructions: Ask these early in a 30–45 minute discovery call. Label each question with the framework it tests. Use the follow-ups (→) as probing prompts to surface evidence you can score.

1. “What are your top business priorities for the next 12–24 months where AI could potentially drive revenue, cost reduction, or customer outcomes?”  
   - Maps: Need / MEDDIC: Metrics  
   - Follow-ups: Which KPIs would change if AI worked? Revenue uplift %, cost % reduction, time-to-market, NPS, churn?  
   - Why: Confirms strategic alignment & measurable outcomes we can target.

2. “Who owns strategy and budget for AI / data & analytics initiatives, and who signs off on hiring or external leadership support?”  
   - Maps: BANT: Authority / MEDDIC: Economic Buyer  
   - → Ask for names, titles, and decision-making timeline.  
   - Why: Identifies economic buyer and influencer map.

3. “Do you have budget allocated for external AI leadership, advisory or fractional executive support this fiscal year? If not, what’s the process to secure it?”  
   - Maps: BANT: Budget  
   - → Get ranges (e.g., <£20k monthly; £8–20k/month; £20k+/month) or approval process.  
   - Why: Confirms ability to pay for the service (from £8k/month upwards).

4. “What attempts have you made already—pilots, vendors, hires—and what were the results or pain points?”  
   - Maps: MEDDIC: Identify Pain / Metrics  
   - → Probe failures: unclear business case, data readiness, governance, vendor lock-in, scope creep.  
   - Why: Reveals common failure modes our Fractional CAIO can prevent.

5. “How mature is your data & ML environment (data quality, centralised platforms, MLOps, analytics teams)? Where are the biggest capability gaps?”  
   - Maps: BANT: Need / MEDDIC: Identify Pain  
   - → Examples: single customer view, clean training data, productionised models, product integration.  
   - Why: Assesses readiness to execute and where we add most value (governance, roadmap, hiring).

6. “What decision criteria will you use to choose an external AI leader or partner?”  
   - Maps: MEDDIC: Decision Criteria  
   - → Look for experience, industry knowledge, proof of outcomes, cultural fit, commercial model (fractional vs full-time).  
   - Why: Helps position Brilliant Noise’s differentiators (Test-Learn-Lead™, marketing heritage, B-Corp).

7. “What is the timeline for selecting a partner and getting started? Are there board / planning cycles or key dates we need to align to?”  
   - Maps: BANT: Timing / MEDDIC: Decision Process  
   - → Get concrete dates: procurement windows, Q-start, campaign launches.  
   - Why: Determines urgency and whether fractional model fits their timing.

8. “Who inside your organisation will champion day-to-day engagement and drive adoption of the AI strategy?”  
   - Maps: MEDDIC: Champion  
   - → Ask for name, role, and level of influence (board-level, direct report to C-suite).  
   - Why: A strong internal champion is critical to success and adoption.

9. “Are there constraints we should know about—procurement rules, headcount freezes, security/compliance issues, or a mandate to only buy technology vs. advisory?”  
   - Maps: BANT: Budget/Constraints / MEDDIC: Decision Process  
   - → Probe procurement cycles, supplier lists, legal approvals, vendor blocking.  
   - Why: Surface blockers early (some procurement regimes will kill a fractional exec model).

10. “How do you or the Board view risk around AI mistakes (financial, brand, regulatory)? What’s the acceptable cost of failure?”  
   - Maps: MEDDIC: Metrics / Economic Buyer / Decision Criteria  
   - → Look for statements like “cannot exceed £x loss”, “brand risk unacceptable,” or “open to experimentation.”  
   - Why: Matches our value proposition: avoid £150K+ mistakes; build governance and risk controls.

2) Red-flag indicators for disqualification (stop signs)
If you see any of these, deprioritise or disqualify until resolved — document for re-engagement.

- No executive sponsor or economic buyer identified (no one will sign or champion).  
- No budget and no realistic path to secure funding this fiscal year (procurements denied, headcount freeze with no external allowance).  
- AI is treated as experimental PR only (no KPI alignment) — lack of measurable outcomes.  
- Procurement/legal will not permit fractional/external senior leadership (policy requires full-time hires).  
- The buyer expects a low-cost implementation-only offshore vendor (they want coding/engineering only, not strategic leadership).  
- Repeated claim “we already have a CAIO” but no evidence of strategic outputs, or the person lacks remit/authority — indicates organisational confusion/blocked remit.  
- Unrealistic timeline pressure (expect full enterprise AI transformation within 30 days) with no staged approach.  
- Data & systems are effectively non-existent, and leadership is unwilling to invest in fundamentals (no appetite for enabling work).  
- High internal political fragmentation — no alignment across Product/Marketing/IT/Legal and no champion to coordinate.  
- Cost of failure intolerance without willingness to run controlled experiments — they want guaranteed outcomes.  
- Existing vendor exclusivity or master vendor restrictions that block working with boutique consultancies.  
- Primary need is tactical delivery (model-building, MLOps) rather than strategic leadership and capability building.

3) Ideal customer scoring criteria (1–10 per criterion)
Use this simple scoring sheet in the CRM. For each criterion rate 1 (poor) — 10 (excellent). Multiply by weight and sum to a 0–100 score. Use descriptors to ensure consistency.

Scoring criteria, weights and descriptors
1. Strategic priority of AI (Weight 20%) — “AI is a board-level priority with KPIs attached.”  
   - 1 = Not strategic or not discussed; 5 = discussed but not resourced; 10 = board-level, KPI-backed, explicitly resourced.

2. Executive sponsorship / Economic buyer commitment (15%) — “Named, engaged sponsor with authority.”  
   - 1 = No sponsor; 5 = interested mid-level contact; 10 = C-suite sponsor willing to allocate budget/time.

3. Budget availability or credible funding path (15%) — “Funds for external leadership available or realistic approval path.”  
   - 1 = No budget/no path; 5 = possible reallocation; 10 = budget approved or allocated (e.g., £8k+/month).

4. Data & technology readiness (15%) — “Foundational data/platforms exist or clear plan to build them.”  
   - 1 = No data maturity & resistance to invest; 5 = some analytics & pilot infra; 10 = centralised data, production-capable analytics.

5. Urgency & timing (10%) — “Decision and start date within 1–3 months”  
   - 1 = No timeline; 5 = 3–6 month horizon; 10 = decision in <30 days and ambition to start immediately.

6. Appetite for capability building & governance (10%) — “Willing to invest in people, training and governance, not just one-off projects.”  
   - 1 = Wants only deliverables; 5 = open to training; 10 = committed to upskilling and governance program.

7. Use-case scale & economic impact (10%) — “Use cases likely to deliver measurable millions in value or strategic moat.”  
   - 1 = No clear high-value use-case; 5 = localised value; 10 = organisation-wide, P&L or customer experience impact.

8. Procurement & contractual feasibility (5%) — “Procure/legal open to contracting a fractional exec consultancy.”  
   - 1 = Procurement blocks fractional hires; 5 = unsure/lengthy process; 10 = procurement happy with consultancy model.

Total weight = 100%. Example scoring: multiply each criterion score (1–10) by its weight percentage, sum to 0–100.

Quick scoring rubric examples (how to translate notes into a score)
- Strategic priority: Board meeting + KPI target this quarter = 9–10; “We talk about AI” = 3–4.  
- Executive sponsor: CMO committed to run a pilot with CAIO = 9; only marketing manager expressed interest = 3.  
- Budget: £96k/year or line-item in budget = 10; “we’d need to ask finance” = 4.  
- Data readiness: single customer view & prod data pipelines present = 9; Excel reports only = 2.  
- Timing: start within 30 days = 10; >6 months = 2.  
- Capability building: willing to train 50 people = 10; no interest in team development = 2.  
- Use-case impact: cost savings of £2m forecast = 10; unknown small experiments = 3.  
- Procurement: existing panel includes boutique consultancies = 10; policy requires FT hire = 1.

Qualification thresholds and interpretation
- 80–100 (High-fit): Priority account — rapid progression to proposal and executive workshop.  
- 60–79 (Medium-fit): Worth pursuing with targeted scopes (diagnostic, 90-day sprint). Build business case & secure sponsor.  
- <60 (Low-fit): Do not prioritise for immediate sales resource. Nurture or disqualify depending on red flags.

4) Next steps based on qualification score (actionable playbook)

A) High-fit (80–100)
Goal: Convert quickly to a scoped engagement (pilot/retainer).

- Immediate actions (within 48 hours):  
  - Send tailored executive summary referencing their KPIs and risk profile; include 2–3 relevant case studies (adidas, BMW style outcomes).  
  - Book a 60–90 minute Executive Alignment Workshop (Brilliant Noise Test-Learn-Lead™ orientation) with the sponsor + 2–3 senior stakeholders.  
  - Prepare a proposed Statement of Work: 90-day Test-Learn-Lead™ sprint priced as a pilot (retainer starting at £8k/month) outlining deliverables, governance, success metrics and escalation to longer-term fractional CAIO.  
  - Provide candidate bios for the Fractional CAIO(s) to fast-track approval.

- Sales cadence: Daily follow-up until workshop scheduled; close POC / contract within 2–4 weeks. Involve legal/procurement early if needed.

B) Medium-fit (60–79)
Goal: De-risk with a low-commitment deliverable and build executive buy-in.

- Immediate actions (within 5 business days):  
  - Propose a 4–6 week “AI Leadership Health Check & Roadmap” (~fixed-fee smaller engagement) to validate use cases, governance, and build a business case. Price as smaller retainer or capped fee.  
  - Offer an on-site or virtual half-day “AI Leadership Briefing” for the exec team to educate and identify champions.  
  - Create a mini business case template showing avoided waste (use the £150K typical waste figure) to help sponsor secure budget.

- Sales cadence: Weekly check-ins; aim to convert to pilot within 6–12 weeks once budget/ sponsor confirmed.

C) Low-fit (<60)
Goal: Avoid wasting senior sales time; nurture or disqualify cleanly.

- If red flags present (see list): politely disqualify. Provide helpful resources: short diagnostic checklist, webinar invite, 1-page guide “How to build internal case for Fractional CAIO.” Mark for 6–12 month nurture.  
- If interest exists but low readiness: offer free 30-minute advisory call with a senior consultant to prioritise next steps and provide a “to-do” list to raise score (e.g., get sponsor, secure budget, tidy data).  
- Set a re-engagement reminder (90–180 days) and capture exactly what must change to requalify.

Operational guidance and templates (practical tips)
- Use these discovery questions as CRM fields; capture direct quotes for scoring evidence.  
- Always record names/titles of sponsor, procurement contact, and legal contact.  
- Attach case studies with directly comparable metrics (industry, scale, KPIs) to proposals.  
- For executive workshops: agenda = outcome framing (10m), maturity assessment (20m), risk & quick-wins (20m), proposed engagement & next steps (10m). Send pre-read including our Test-Learn-Lead™ one-pager.  
- Use the “avoid £150K+ mistakes” message as a quantifier in business case templates; show ROI for a £8k/month engagement vs. cost of one failed pilot.  
- If procurement requires supplier vetting, be ready with insurance, B-Corp certification, templates for Statement of Work, and references.

Example scoring scenario (concise)
- Company A: Board goal = “AI-driven personalised offers to lift revenue 3%” (9), CMO committed (9), Budget line exists £150k/year (10), Data: CDP + analytics team (8), Timing: start in 6 weeks (8), Capability appetite: high (9), Use-case scale: enterprise-wide (9), Procurement: comfortable (8) → Weighted score ≈ 88 → High-fit → book Exec Workshop + 90-day sprint SOW.

Final note
This framework is intentionally normative: score consistently, disqualify early where structural blockers exist (procurement, no sponsor, no budget), and prioritise conversations that align to enterprise-level KPIs and governance. The fractional CAIO sells when you can promise confident decision-making, reduced risk of £150K+ wasted spend, and a rapid path from pilot to scaled advantage — aim your discovery to surface exactly those elements.

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a one-page checklist + CRM field list to paste into your system, or  
- Create a sample 90-day SOW template aligned to a High-fit outcome. Which would help most?
