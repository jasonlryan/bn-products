AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO)
Quick reference for sales conversations — focused on business outcomes

1) Primary capabilities (3–5) — what we do and the business benefit
- Strategic AI roadmapping & prioritisation
  - Benefit: Aligns AI initiatives to revenue, cost and customer KPIs so leaders invest in what drives measurable business value — faster time-to-value and fewer wasted pilots.
- Risk management, governance & ethical guardrails
  - Benefit: Reduces exposure to regulatory, reputational and implementation risk so projects stay on budget and legal/compliance overhead is minimised.
- Executive coaching & decision support
  - Benefit: Rapidly upgrades leadership confidence to make high‑stakes AI choices (vendor selection, build vs buy, major investments) without hiring a costly CAIO — avoiding costly missteps.
- Capability building & talent strategy
  - Benefit: Turns existing teams into repeatable capability (training, role design, recruitment support) so AI work scales internally and dependency on external consultants falls over time.
- Pilot-to-scale delivery oversight
  - Benefit: Ensures one or more pilots convert to fully operational programs that deliver measurable ROI rather than becoming stalled experiments.

2) Delivery method — how it works in practice (what the client experiences)
- Fractional, subscription model (from £8k/month) providing an executive‑level partner on a predictable retainer.
- Clear engagement cadence: executive 1:1s + leadership briefings (weekly/biweekly), monthly strategy reviews, quarterly roadmap refreshes.
- Outcome‑focused deliverables: board‑ready strategy papers, prioritised opportunity map, risk & governance framework, pilot success criteria, scaled playbooks and a skills development plan.
- Hands‑on support when needed: run rapid discovery sprints, chair AI steering group meetings, coax pilots through deployment gates, and support hiring decisions.
- Transfer of capability: every engagement includes coaching and playbooks so the client builds internal muscle and reduces reliance over time.

3) Integration points — where we plug into existing tools, teams and processes
- Executive & strategy workflows: integrates into C-suite/steering committee cadence and existing OKR/KPI cycles to keep AI aligned to business goals.
- Marketing & commercial workflows: aligns with martech, campaign planning, product roadmaps and customer insight teams to surface value quickly.
- Data & analytics teams: coordinates priorities and governance with data owners so initiatives use trusted sources and scale reliably.
- Technology & procurement: advises vendor evaluation, RFPs and vendor‑management processes to avoid costly vendor lock-in mistakes.
- People & L&D: embeds training, role definitions and hiring support into HR processes to speed capability development.
- Test-Learn-Lead™ process: complements and accelerates your existing experimentation cycle — we prioritise, de‑risk and scale the winners.
Business outcome: minimal disruption, faster decisions, and immediate alignment with existing operational rhythms.

4) Capability roadmap — today vs 6-month vision (business milestones)
- Today (what clients get immediately)
  - Executive AI strategy, prioritised opportunity map and risk/governance framework.
  - Skills assessment and a detailed people/talent plan with recruitment guidance.
  - Rapid pilot prioritisation and hands‑on oversight for 1–2 critical use cases.
  - Executive coaching and board‑ready briefings to accelerate decision‑making.
  - Immediate reduction in high‑risk choices and avoidance of typical £150K+ pilot waste.
- 6‑month vision (what success looks like)
  - Embedded operating model or Center of Excellence: documented playbooks, scaled delivery process and clear handover to internal teams.
  - Measurable outcomes from at least one scaled use case (revenue lift, cost reduction, or customer experience gain).
  - Fully operational governance & KPI dashboard driving continuous prioritisation and ROI tracking.
  - Trained internal champions and a recruitment pipeline that significantly reduces reliance on fractional support.
  - Vendor ecosystem and procurement approach optimised to protect margins and speed deployment.
Business outcome: predictable, repeatable AI capability that drives measurable growth/efficiency while costing a fraction of hiring a full-time CAIO.

Use these bullets in sales conversations to:
- Show immediate executive value (confidence, risk reduction, prioritisation).
- Quantify the cost/benefit vs hiring (£8k/month vs £200k+ hire and avoided £150k+ mistakes).
- Paint a six‑month transformation path from advisory to embedded capability.
