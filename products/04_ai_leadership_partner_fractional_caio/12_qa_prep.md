# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Qa Prep

1) Q: What is the market opportunity for a Fractional CAIO service?  
A: We address the large and growing enterprise market of marketing transformation and AI advisory — organisations reallocating CMO/CDO budgets to AI-driven capability building — driven by urgency to avoid costly AI mistakes; demand is broad across global brands and scale-ups.  
Follow-up: I can send our TAM slide with sources and target ICP counts.

2) Q: What is your sustainable moat vs consultancies and tech vendors?  
A: Our moat combines marketing domain expertise, the Test‑Learn‑Lead™ playbook, B‑Corp trusted-brand positioning and a network of senior AI leaders — a blended people+process advantage that big firms replicate slowly.  
Follow-up: Want a one‑page comparison of capability vs McKinsey, Big Tech and pure-play implementers?

3) Q: How do you scale a high‑touch, fractional advisory model profitably?  
A: We scale with standardised engagement templates, tiered subscription packages, a vetted bench of fractional CAIOs, and productised capability programs that reduce bespoke hours while keeping high client value.  
Follow-up: I can share our utilisation model and engagement templates.

4) Q: What do the unit economics look like (margins, CAC, payback)?  
A: As a high‑value professional services model, we target strong gross margins (typical of consultancies), front‑loaded CAC recovered through multi‑month retainers, and payback within several quarters with LTV/CAC targets >3.  
Follow-up: Request our anonymised unit‑economics spreadsheet and assumptions.

5) Q: Why charge from £8k/month — won’t clients pick cheaper alternatives?  
A: £8k/month reflects CAIO‑level senior expertise and risk‑reduction versus a £200k hire; cheaper options tend to leave clients with expensive failed pilots, whereas we quantify avoided waste and faster time‑to‑value.  
Follow-up: I can send the hire vs fractional ROI calculator.

6) Q: Do you have the team depth and senior bench to serve multiple global brands?  
A: Yes — founders and leadership bring 15+ years in digital transformation, supported by a curated network of senior CAIOs, data governance specialists and marketing AI practitioners to scale safely.  
Follow-up: I’ll share senior bios and current bench availability.

7) Q: How do you acquire and convert enterprise clients?  
A: We target CMOs/CDOs via referral partnerships, case studies with adidas/BMW/Nestlé, targeted executive briefs (30–60 minutes) and value‑led pilots that convert to longer retainers.  
Follow-up: Want our GTM playbook and conversion metrics?

8) Q: What are your retention and expansion dynamics with clients?  
A: Retention is driven by measurable decision‑quality improvements and capability building; once trust is established we expand into execution support, recruitment and longer‑term transformation roadmaps.  
Follow-up: I can share anonymised NRR examples and an expansion case study.

9) Q: What are the biggest business risks and how do you mitigate them?  
A: Key risks are commoditisation, talent churn and vendor lock‑in; mitigations include continual upskilling, a playbook that embeds client capabilities, recurring contracts and vendor‑neutral governance frameworks.  
Follow-up: I’ll send our risk register and mitigation playbook.

10) Q: Do you have defensible IP or is this replicable consulting?  
A: Our defensibility is in proprietary playbooks, test frameworks, client onboarding accelerators and accumulated client outcomes — creating repeatable results and switching costs even without heavy software IP.  
Follow-up: Request anonymised playbook excerpts and success metrics.

11) Q: How do you manage data privacy, PII and model‑training risk for clients?  
A: We adopt a privacy‑first approach: we avoid unnecessary PII transfer, mandate secure on‑prem or private‑cloud model options, run vendor security assessments and embed data governance into every roadmap.  
Follow-up: I can provide our data governance checklist and vendor assessment template.

12) Q: For investors, what’s the scalable exit or growth pathway?  
A: We plan scalable growth via international expansion, platformising services and deepening productised offerings — making us attractive for bolt‑on acquisition by larger consultancies or tech firms pursuing go‑to‑market capability.  
Follow-up: I’ll share our 3–5 year growth scenarios and potential exit maps.
