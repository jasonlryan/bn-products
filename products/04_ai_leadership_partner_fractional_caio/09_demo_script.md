# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Demo Script

Hook — 0:10
Say (fast, curious): “Imagine CAIO-level decisions — without hiring a CAIO. What if your next AI move didn’t cost you £200k or leave you with a pilot that wastes £150k?” (pause)

Context — 0:20
Say (warm, confident): “I’m from Brilliant Noise — a Brighton B‑Corp that helps global brands like adidas, BMW and Nestlé turn AI from risk into advantage. Our AI Leadership Partner is a fractional CAIO: strategic AI leadership, exec coaching and team development from £8,000/month so you move fast, avoid costly mistakes and build real capability.”

Live Flow — 1:30 (6 steps, ~15s each)  
Step 1 — Quick Diagnose (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 1 — Quick Diagnose.” Say: “We start with a rapid 2‑week assessment: business priorities, data readiness and where AI can move KPIs fastest.”  
On-screen: one-slide summary of gaps & opportunity.

Step 2 — Prioritise for Value (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 2 — Prioritise for value.” Say: “We convert that assessment into a ranked roadmap — revenue, cost or customer impact — so pilots target measurable wins, not vanity projects.”

Step 3 — Test-Learn-Lead™ Pilot (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 3 — Test-Learn-Lead™.” Say: “We run rapid experiments to prove value. Fast learning, clear go/no‑go decisions — so you scale what works and stop what doesn’t.”

Step 4 — Risk & Governance (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 4 — Govern with confidence.” Say: “We put in proportionate governance and standards — model risk, data use, vendor selection — to avoid regulatory and reputational hits.”

Step 5 — Team & Capability Build (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 5 — Build capability.” Say: “We coach your execs, upskill teams and help recruit the right people — so the capability stays in‑house as you scale.”

Step 6 — Measure & Iterate (0:15)  
Spoken cue: “Step 6 — Measure and iterate.” Say: “We track KPIs, update the roadmap, and keep the C-suite informed — turning short pilots into sustained competitive moats.”

Wow Moment — 0:10
Say (pause, decisive): “Put simply: CAIO-level decisions from £8k/month — not a £200k hire, and far less than the £150k most organisations waste on bad AI bets.”

Objection Handling — 0:20 (two quick counters)  
Objection 1 — “We can hire a CAIO.”  
Counter (concise): “True — but hiring takes months and costs £200k+. Our fractional CAIO buys you immediate, senior leadership plus hands-on delivery while you recruit the perfect permanent hire — or choose to scale the fractional model.”

Objection 2 — “Is this just consultancy hype?”  
Counter (concise): “Not at all. We pair strategy with Test‑Learn‑Lead™ experiments, governance and capability transfer. Clients like adidas and Nestlé use us to avoid wasted pilots and lock in measurable ROI.”

Call to Action — 0:30
Say (friendly, direct): “If this resonates, let’s do a 30‑minute AI leadership review. We’ll run a short diagnostic, show a 90‑day priority roadmap and map the commercial case. I can send a calendar link now — or you can reach out via brilliantnoise.com. Which would you prefer?” (pause for response)
