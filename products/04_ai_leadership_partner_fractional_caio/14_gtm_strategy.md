# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — Go‑to‑Market for AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO)
Brilliant Noise — Fractional CAIO service (from £8k/month)
Purpose: A practical, step‑by‑step GTM playbook to acquire, deliver and scale AI Leadership Partner to 10x revenue while protecting quality, B‑Corp values and brand positioning.

ASSUMPTIONS & BASELINE (be explicit up front)
- Pricing tiers (recommended):
  - Starter (0.2 FTE) — £8k/month (2 days/week)
  - Core (0.5 FTE) — £18k/month (approx 2.5 days/week)
  - Embedded (1.0 FTE) — £32k/month (full-time)
- Current capacity (example baseline — adjust to your actuals):
  - Senior CAIOs available today: 3
  - Each senior CAIO can manage ~6 x 0.2 FTE or 3 x 0.5 FTE or 1–2 embedded accounts (mix matters).
  - Baseline revenue per month if fully utilised at mixed package = ~£100k (adjust as needed).
- Goal: 10x revenue in 36 months (flexible). This playbook shows the levers and a timeline to achieve that target via pricing, productization, scaling team and partnerships.

1) CHANNEL STRATEGY — primary & secondary channels with rationale
Primary channels (highest near‑term ROI for enterprise sales)
- Direct Enterprise Sales + Account-Based Marketing (ABM)
  - Rationale: Target ICPs (CMOs, CDOs) require trusted relationships, personalised outreach, and proof points. Brilliant Noise already has brand credibility with global clients.
  - Tactics: 1:1 outreach, targeted executive briefings, industry vertical plays (CPG, Retail, Automotive).
- Existing Client Expansion & Client Success (land & expand)
  - Rationale: Easiest conversion, higher ACV, strong references/case studies.
  - Tactics: Executive reviews, internal AI capability audits offered free/discounted to current clients.
- Strategic Partnerships & Channel Resellers (Technology & Boutique Consultancies)
  - Rationale: Multiply reach and credibility; co-sell opportunities; access to enterprise procurement processes.
  - Tactics: Alliances with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), data platforms, and digital consultancies who lack senior AI leadership.

Secondary channels (supporting volume & demand)
- Thought Leadership & PR (LinkedIn, trade press, podcasts)
  - Rationale: Builds credibility at executive level; helps qualification.
- Events, Workshops & Executive Roundtables
  - Rationale: Rapid relationship-building with decision-makers; lead magnet.
- Referrals & Alumni Network (B‑Corp community, founders’ network)
  - Rationale: Value-aligned introductions; high close rate.

Risk monitoring metrics
- Pipeline coverage ratio (target 3–4x bookings)
- CAIO bench depth (number of available CAIOs for new onboarding within 30 days)
- Average procurement cycle time (target <45 days)
- Service quality (NPS >= 60, pilot success rate >= 75%)

9) MEASUREMENT & DASHBOARD (what to track weekly/monthly)
Weekly
- Leads, outreach activity (SDR), ABM meetings booked
- CAIO utilisation % and bench availability
Monthly
- New ARR booked, pipeline change, churn risk list
- Time-to-first-value median, pilot conversion %
Quarterly
