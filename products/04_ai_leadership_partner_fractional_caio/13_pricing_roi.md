# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Pricing Roi

Below is a compact, actionable business model and pricing analysis for AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) tailored to Brilliant Noise. Numbers are realistic estimates — change any assumption to model your exact cost base.

1) Business Model Canvas (high level)
- Key partners: Senior AI partners/contractors, data-science contractors, MLOps/tool vendors (OpenAI, Azure, Snowflake), recruitment partners, legal/compliance, training providers.
- Key activities: Fractional AI leadership retainer, strategy & roadmaps, governance/risk design, team capability uplift, recruitment support, prioritized test-and-learn programs.
- Key resources: Senior CAIOs, senior consultants, IP/playbooks (Test‑Learn‑Lead™), tooling stack, sales/account team.
- Value propositions: Executive-level AI strategy without full‑time hire risk; avoid costly implementation mistakes; accelerate time‑to‑value.
- Customer relationships: High-touch retainer, monthly board-level advisory, quarterly roadmaps, workshop series.
- Channels: Direct sales to CMOs/CDOs, referrals from existing global brands, thought leadership, partner referrals.
- Customer segments: Large enterprises (10k+ employees, £500M+ revenue), scale-ups with high growth/complexity.
- Cost structure: People (~60% of revenue), tools/licenses (~5–8%), G&A & marketing (~15–20%), contractor/CAC variability.
- Revenue streams: Monthly retainers (from £8k/m), tiered packages (advisory, advisory+execution, embedded CAIO), project fees (diagnostics), training & recruitment success fees.

2) Unit Economics (assumptions + numbers)
Assumptions:
- Typical contract length = 12 months; average gross COGS = 45% of revenue; fixed annual overhead = £200k; CAC per client = £12k (advisory), £20k (mid), £35k (embedded).
Tiers (examples):
- Advisory (entry) £8k/m → Revenue/year = £96k. COGS (45%) = £43.2k. Gross profit = £52.8k (55% GM). Contribution = £52.8k - CAC(£12k) = £40.8k.
- Advisory + Execution £15k/m → Revenue/year = £180k. COGS = £81k. GP = £99k. Contribution after CAC(£20k) = £79k.
- Embedded CAIO £30k/m → Revenue/year = £360k. COGS = £162k. GP = £198k. Contribution after CAC(£35k) = £163k.

Breakeven (company level):
- Cover fixed costs (£200k) with mid-tier contribution (£99k) → ~2.0 mid-tier clients; realistic target = 3 mid-tier retainers to be comfortably profitable.

3) Pricing Strategy
- Model: Tiered value-based retainers (Advisory £8k/m; Mid £15k/m; Embedded £25–35k/m). Keep minimum 12‑month commitment.
- Justification: Price anchored vs. risk of full‑time CAIO (£200k+); value capture from avoided mistakes (~£150k one‑off) and prioritized revenue/cost uplift.
- Competitive positioning: Premium boutique — higher stakeholder access and faster commercialisation than agencies; more practical and lower-cost than Big 4.
- Price testing framework: 1) A/B offer pages for pilot discounts (10–20% limited-time), 2) Sales experiments with different anchors (show full-time hire cost vs retainer), 3) Win/loss pricing interviews capturing willingness-to-pay, 4) Track conversion and CAC by price band; iterate quarterly.

4) Scalability Analysis
- Capacity constraints: Senior CAIO time (scarce), quality control of strategic advice, availability of senior consultants.
- Path to scale:
  - Hire/bench mid-senior consultants to offload execution.
  - Productize playbooks (diagnostic, roadmap, governance packs).
  - Move from bespoke to modular retainers (packages + add-ons).
- Automation & leverage:
  - AI-enabled diagnostics (auto-assessments), templated roadmaps, generative-deliverable drafts (presentations, risk registers).
  - Client-facing portals, automated meeting preparation, learning platforms to scale training.
Actionable: aim to standardize 60% of deliverables within 12 months to increase senior CAIO utilization from 40% to 60%.

5) ROI Framework (example client: enterprise with £500M revenue)
Assumptions: avoided one-off waste = £150k; uplift from prioritized AI = % of revenue annually.
- Conservative: uplift 0.1% = £500k → Total year‑1 benefit = £650k. Engagement cost = £96k. ROI multiple = 6.8x. Payback = ~1.8 months.
- Base: uplift 0.5% = £2.5M → Total = £2.65M. ROI = 27.6x. Payback < 1 month.
- Aggressive: uplift 1.0% = £5.0M → Total = £5.15M. ROI = 53.6x. Payback << 1 month.
Value metrics to sell: time-to-value (weeks to first prioritized initiative), reduction in failed pilots (%), avoided implementation loss, estimated incremental revenue or cost savings by initiative.

6) Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell opportunities: Implementation/POC → MLOps & model ops, training subscriptions, recruitment success fees, data platform advisory, enterprise governance programs.
- Recurring revenue potential: diagnostic subscriptions, executive coaching blocks, ongoing governance / audit retainer.
- CLTV example (mid-tier):
  - ARPA = £180k/yr; average tenure = 24 months → Revenue = £360k. Gross margin 55% → contribution ~£198k. Less CAC (£20k) → LTV ≈ £178k. LTV:CAC ≈ 9:1 (healthy).
Actionables:
- Focus on 3 anchor offers (Advisory £8k, Mid £15k, Embedded £30k). Target win rates: Advisory → upgrade funnel to Mid in 6–12 months via delivered roadmap + quick wins.
- KPI dashboard: ARPA, CAC, Gross Margin, Time-to-first-win, Conversion Advisory→Mid, Net Retention.

Summary recommendation: keep entry price at £8k/m to capture low‑risk trials, prioritize productization to lift senior utilization to 60% and standardize templates to protect margins, and sell outcome-based ROI narratives (avoid £150k+ mistakes + measurable uplift) to justify premium tiering.
