# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Functional Specification

AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) — Functional Specification

1) Overview (what it does)
- Acts as the organisation’s interim Chief AI Officer on a fractional basis: shapes AI strategy, prioritises high‑value use cases, reduces implementation risk, coaches executives, and builds client capability.
- Converts AI opportunity into measurable commercial outcomes (revenue, cost, customer KPIs) using Brilliant Noise’s Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach.
- Designed for CMOs, CDOs and exec teams that need senior AI leadership without a full‑time hire.

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Executive sponsor and steering group (named stakeholders + decision authority).
- Current strategy, KPIs and business objectives (revenue, cost, customer metrics).
- Org chart, team roles, hiring budget and appetite for change.
- Inventory of available data sources, systems and vendor contracts (high level).
- Recent AI initiatives/pilot reports and known failure points.
- Monthly budget commitment (from £8,000/month) and target engagement duration (typical 3–12 months).
- Access to 4–8 core SMEs for workshops and regular governance meetings.

3) Core Process (step-by-step how it works)
1. Alignment & Discovery (Weeks 0–2): confirm objectives, governance, constraints; rapid stakeholder interviews; validate data and resource availability.
2. Situation Assessment (Weeks 2–4): prioritise pain points vs. opportunity; skills gap analysis; audit prior pilots and vendor landscape.
3. Strategic Roadmap (Weeks 4–6): produce 12–24 month AI roadmap mapping initiatives to KPIs, expected ROI, resourcing and risk profile.
4. Prioritisation & Business Cases (Weeks 6–8): score initiatives (value/effort/risk), produce 1‑pager and slide deck for board approval, recommend pilots for Test phase.
5. Test‑Learn Execution Oversight (Ongoing): govern pilot selection, define success metrics, run review cadence, extract learnings and decide scale vs. kill.
6. Capability & Hiring (Ongoing): training plan, role/spec templates, interview support and vendor shortlist to build internal muscle.
7. Governance & Risk (Ongoing): implement data/AI governance, compliance checklist, and operating model for scaled delivery.
8. Transition & Handover (End of engagement): adoptable playbooks, KPI dashboards and roadmap for in‑house CAIO or partner.

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Executive one‑page AI strategy + 10–12 slide board business case.
- Prioritised AI roadmap with timelines, owners, ROI and dependencies.
- 3–5 prioritised business cases (one‑page + financials) and pilot charters.
- Governance framework, risk register and compliance checklist.
- Skills assessment report and recruitment pack (JD, interview rubric).
- Coaching: monthly executive sessions + bi‑weekly steering meetings.
- Playbooks, KPI dashboard templates and handover materials.

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Board approval of AI roadmap and funding for at least one pilot within 90 days.
- Clear ROI/impact projections for prioritized pilots (expected payback ≤12 months where applicable).
- Time‑to‑first‑value: pilot delivering measurable KPI improvement within 3–6 months.
- Reduction in projected pilot failure/waste (target: avoid typical £150K+ mistakes).
- Skill uplift: target % of roles with defined hiring/training plan and first hires placed within agreed window.
- Stakeholder satisfaction ≥80% in quarterly reviews.

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Service is strategic and advisory — not a delivery/engineering build team; implementation partners may be required.
- Outcomes depend on client access to people, data and budget; Brilliant Noise cannot guarantee ROI if execution constraints persist.
- Fractional engagement implies limited weekly hours; scope must be prioritised to match capacity.
- Legal, regulatory or data privacy restrictions may limit feasible use cases.
- Not a replacement for permanent CAIO when continuous, day‑to‑day presence is required.
