# AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO) • Presentation Structure

Presentation Playbook — AI Leadership Partner (Fractional CAIO)
Purpose: A modular, repeatable sales presentation structure to sell Brilliant Noise’s AI Leadership Partner. Use this playbook to run consistent 30–60 minute buyer sessions, and to branch into technical, ROI or implementation deep-dives when needed.

Session formats (recommended)
- 30-minute executive brief — Core 10-slide deck + 10 min Q&A. (Fast close / discovery)
- 45-minute standard meeting — Core deck + 15-minute optional deep-dive (choose one module). (Most common)
- 60–90 minute workshop — Core deck + two deep-dive modules + interactive workshop/demo. (For committed prospects)

Roles in the room
- Lead presenter (sales + product): owns narrative, transitions, CTA
- Technical SME: joins for technical/implementation deep-dive
- Account owner / executive sponsor (Brilliant Noise): available for credibility and negotiation
- Note-taker / follow-up owner

Core deck: 10-slide outline (total ~25–30 minutes)

Customization guide — tailor the deck by audience
General rule: Keep core messages consistent; change emphasis, metrics, language and visuals by audience.

Audience: Executive (CMO, CDO, CEO)
- Tone: Strategic, outcomes-first, risk-aware, concise.
- Emphasise: ROI, avoided waste, competitive advantage, governance, brief client outcomes.
- Slides to expand: Slide 2 (problem), Slide 6 (case studies), Slide 8 (90-day roadmap), ROI deep-dive.
- Questions to anticipate: “What is the business impact?” “How fast to value?” “Who owns risk?”
- Transition triggers: “If your board cares about risk, highlight Slide 9.”

Audience: Technical (CTO, Head of Data, Engineers)
- Tone: Precise, evidence-based, detailed.
- Emphasise: architecture, data readiness, MLOps, integration complexity, security.
- Slides to expand: Slide 4 (method), Slide 5 (capabilities), Module A.
- Questions to anticipate: “What does integration cost?” “How do you handle data governance?”
- Demo to show: data inventory, architecture, monitoring dashboards.

Audience: End-user / Operational (Marketing ops, analysts)
- Tone: Practical, workflow-focused, hands-on.
- Emphasise: tooling, training, day-to-day change, how it simplifies work, quick wins.
- Slides to expand: Slide 7 (engagement model), Slide 8 (90-day roadmap), Module C.
- Questions to anticipate: “How will my team be supported?” “What training is included?”
- Demo to show: sample playbooks, training module, user interface screenshots.

Audience tailoring checklist (quick)
- Executive: shorten technical slides, add ROI slide up front, use 30-min format.
- Technical: add Module A, bring SME, plan 45–60 min.
- End-user: add Module C, show training materials, allow Q&A from daily users.

Visual & demo insertion points (detailed)
- Slide 1 (Title): Animated company/client logo reveal (30s) — builds credibility.
- After Slide 3 (Solution): 60–90s recorded “CAIO coaching” clip — humanises service.
- Slide 4 (Method): Animated Test-Learn-Lead flow with one live example (screen share).
- Slide 6 (Proof): 2–3 minute case study video or before/after dashboard screenshots.
- Slide 7 (Pricing): Interactive pricing calculator (live fill-in if prospect shares numbers).
- Slide 8 (90-day roadmap): Live walkthrough of a real roadmap doc (editable template).
- Slide 9 (Governance): Sample policy/decision matrix PDF for download.
- Slide 10 (CTA): ROI payback visualization (live) + booking link for diagnostic.
Demo best-practices:
- Have short video backups (60–90s) for every live demo.
- Preload slide with a static screenshot as fallback.
- If running live ROI demo, ask for one or two input numbers in advance (revenue baseline or pilot budget).
- Assign technical SME to manage any live tool demos.

Handling objections (short scripts)
- “Why not just hire a CAIO?” — “Hiring takes time and cost >£200k; our model de‑risks decisions and buys time to hire correctly, or removes the need altogether.”
- “How do I measure success?” — “We set KPIs in the diagnostic: revenue impact, cost saved, pilot win rate, and governance adherence — reported monthly.”
- “What if my data isn’t ready?” — “We assess data readiness in week 1 and design minimal viable tests that work with current data while increasing maturity.”

Close & next steps (playbook)
- Default CTA: Book a 4–6 week diagnostic workshop to produce a prioritised AI roadmap and pilot brief.
- If price sensitivity: Offer a 4‑week discovery for a capped fee followed by a recommended pilot.
- Follow-up pack to send within 24 hours: tailored one-page executive summary, 90-day roadmap PDF, case study relevant to buyer, proposed diagnostic SOW and scheduling link.

Presentation day checklist (pre-flight)
- Confirm attendees & their roles; customise slides for primary audience.
- Tech check: screen share, video playback, audio, presenter remote.
- Prepare demo backups: video + screenshots + static slide.
- Pre-fill ROI calculator with sample numbers or ask prospect for 2 inputs in advance.
- Print/prepare one-page executive summary to email instantly after meeting.

Estimated timing templates
- 30-minute exec session: Core deck (22 min), Q&A (8 min). Skip deep-dives.
- 45-minute session: Core deck (25 min), chosen deep-dive (15 min), Q&A (5 min).
- 60-minute session: Core deck (25–30 min), two deep-dives (20–25 min), Q&A / next steps (5–10 min).

Usage notes
- Keep the 10-slide core deck tight and outcome-driven. Use deep-dives only when asked or when appropriate stakeholders are present.
- Always surface the Test‑Learn‑Lead™ process early — it ties capability to reduced risk.
- Emphasise the commercial delta: “fractional CAIO from £8k/month vs £200k+ hire; avoid £150k+ typical pilot waste.”

If you want, I can:
- Produce a customizable slide template with slide notes and presenter script lines for each slide.
- Generate a one-page diagnostic SOW template and ROI calculator spreadsheet prefilled with industry example numbers.
