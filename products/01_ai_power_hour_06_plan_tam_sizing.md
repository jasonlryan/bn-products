## Generated Output

In order to estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI Power Hour, we need to consider the total number of potential customers (high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads) in the industries we are targeting who could benefit from our product. 

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume that we're focusing on the UK market initially. We'll also assume that we're targeting companies with more than 50 employees, as they are more likely to have the roles (high-level executives, functional heads, and team leads) that would benefit from AI Power Hour.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we could calculate the TAM:

1. **Identify the Number of Target Companies in the UK:** According to the Office for National Statistics, there were about 27,000 businesses with 50 or more employees in the UK in 2020 (excluding the public sector). 

2. **Estimate the Number of Potential Customers per Company:** Let's assume each of these companies has five employees (CEO, CIO, CMO, Head of Customer Experience, and a Team Lead) who would be interested in AI Power Hour. This is a conservative estimate given larger companies will likely have multiple functional heads and team leads who could benefit from the product.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Potential Customers:** Multiply the number of target companies by the estimated number of potential customers per company. 

   Total Potential Customers = Number of Target Companies * Potential Customers per Company 
   = 27,000 companies * 5 potential customers per company 
   = 135,000 potential customers

4. **Estimate the Revenue per Customer:** This is the price of AI Power Hour, which is £300.

5. **Calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Multiply the total number of potential customers by the revenue per customer.

   TAM = Total Potential Customers * Revenue per Customer 
   = 135,000 potential customers * £300 per customer 
   = £40,500,000

So, based on these assumptions, the TAM for AI Power Hour in the UK market is approximately £40.5 million. 

Please note that this is a simplified approach to estimating the TAM. It's based on a number of assumptions and doesn't take into account factors like market penetration rate, growth rate, or competitive landscape. Further research and a more detailed analysis may be required for a more accurate estimate.
