## Generated Output

**Competing Product 1: Design Sprint Workshop by AJ&Smart**

*Value Proposition:* AJ&Smart's Design Sprint is a four-day process for rapidly solving big challenges, creating new products, or improving existing ones. It goes from problem to tested solution very quickly and is designed to offer a clear process, not just theory.

*Pricing:* Prices are not publicly listed and need to be requested.

*Strengths:* AJ&Smart is a well-known product design and innovation studio. Their Design Sprint process is based on the Google Ventures model and has been refined over time. They have a strong reputation and a proven track record.

*Weaknesses:* The workshop does not explicitly incorporate AI tools into the process and is more focused on traditional design thinking methods. The four-day process might also be too long for some teams.

*Gap We Exploit:* Our AI Innovation Day is a one-day workshop that uses AI tools to accelerate the ideation and prototyping process, offering a unique value proposition that is not available with AJ&Smart's Design Sprint.

**Competing Product 2: IDEO Design Thinking Workshop**

*Value Proposition:* IDEO's Design Thinking Workshop is a one- or two-day immersive experience designed to up-skill teams in the world-renowned design thinking methodology, fostering innovation and problem-solving.

*Pricing:* Prices are not publicly listed and need to be requested.

*Strengths:* IDEO is a globally recognized leader in design thinking. Their workshop offers hands-on learning from experienced facilitators, with a focus on practical application.

*Weaknesses:* The workshop is more focused on teaching the design thinking methodology, rather than providing end-to-end support in developing a working concept or prototype. It also does not incorporate AI tools.

*Gap We Exploit:* Our AI Innovation Day provides full-day, end-to-end prototyping support using AI tools, resulting in a ready-to-share digital output. This offers clients a tangible outcome and practical experience with AI, which IDEO's workshop does not.

**Competing Product 3: Sprintbase Design Sprint**

*Value Proposition:* Sprintbase's Design Sprint is a remote, team-based innovation platform that guides teams through a design thinking process to generate and validate ideas quickly.

*Pricing:* Prices are not publicly listed and need to be requested. 

*Strengths:* Sprintbase's platform enables remote collaboration, making it useful for distributed teams. It offers guided support throughout the process and focuses on practical application.

*Weaknesses:* While the platform aids in remote collaboration, it does not offer the same level of facilitation, expert coaching, and AI integration that our AI Innovation Day does. The emphasis is more on the design thinking process than on rapid prototyping.

*Gap We Exploit:* Our AI Innovation Day not only supports remote collaboration but also provides expert-led facilitation and coaching, as well as the use of AI tools for swift prototyping. This combination of expert support and AI integration is unique to our offering.

**Competing Product 4: Google Ventures Design Sprint**

*Value Proposition:* The Google Ventures Design Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.

*Pricing:* Prices are not publicly listed and need to be requested.

*Strengths:* The Google Ventures Design Sprint is a tried and tested method that has been adopted by many organizations worldwide. It has a strong reputation and a clear, structured process.

*Weaknesses:* The process takes five days, which may be too long for some organizations. It is also more traditional in its approach and does not incorporate AI tools.

*Gap We Exploit:* Our AI Innovation Day condenses the sprint process into one day and incorporates AI tools for faster ideation and prototyping. This makes our workshop more efficient and better suited to organizations under pressure to deliver faster.

**Competing Product 5: InVision Design Sprint Workshop**

*Value Proposition:* InVision's Design Sprint Workshop is a two-day, onsite workshop that teaches teams the design sprint methodology, providing hands-on experience with a focus on learning-by-doing.

*Pricing:* Prices are not publicly listed and need to be requested.

*Strengths:* InVision is a recognized name in the design industry, and their workshop offers hands-on learning from experienced facilitators.

*Weaknesses:* The workshop is more focused on teaching the design sprint methodology, rather than providing end-to-end support in developing a working concept or prototype. It does not incorporate AI tools into the process.

*Gap We Exploit:* Our AI Innovation Day not only teaches teams the sprint process but also provides end-to-end support in developing a working concept or prototype using AI tools. This results in a tangible outcome and practical experience with AI, which InVision's workshop does not offer.
