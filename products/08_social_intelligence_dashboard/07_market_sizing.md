# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Market Sizing

Below I estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for Brilliant Noise’s Social Intelligence Dashboard (primary market = automotive & motorcycle companies meeting the ICP). I show two approaches (Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up), all formulas and assumptions (explicit), sensitivity results (±20% on key levers) and final TAM / SAM / SOM figures with a short reconciliation and three GTM implications.

Summary (quick)
- Bottom‑up TAM (base case): £120M / year
- Top‑down TAM (base case): £288M / year
- Reconciled view: reasonable TAM range ≈ £120M–£320M; midpoint ≈ £200M
- Example SAM (addressable with current product/features): £36M (bottom‑up) / £72M (top‑down)
- Example SOM (realistic 3‑yr capture for Brilliant Noise): ~£0.7M (base) — scalable with subscription/partnerships

SECTION A — Definitions & formulas
- TAM (annual): total annual revenue if every potential customer in the primary market bought the product once in a year.
- SAM: portion of TAM addressable by Brilliant Noise given product fit (features, geography, buyer type).
- SOM (near‑term obtainable): portion of SAM Brilliant Noise can realistically capture within a near horizon (e.g., 3 years).

Formulas used:
- Bottom‑up TAM = (# target companies) × (average price per customer per year)
- SAM = TAM × (% of TAM that matches product fit / target ICP)
- SOM = SAM × (realistic market share achievable in timeframe)

- Top‑down TAM = (Global market size for comparable category) × (share represented by automotive & motorcycle)
- Then apply product-fit and obtainable slices for SAM & SOM similarly.

SECTION B — Bottom‑Up method (customer-count × price)

Assumptions (explicit)
1. Target universe = companies in automotive & motorcycle sectors with revenue ≥ €50M that actively launch models/operate across markets and therefore need multiregional consumer/product intelligence. This includes OEMs, major motorcycle brands, and Tier‑1 suppliers and large aftermarket/brand groups.
2. Base number of target companies (N_base) = 3,000 globally.
   - Rationale: top ~100 OEMs + ~2,500 suppliers/large component makers/discrete vehicle brands and global motorcycle makers that meet ≥€50M. This is a reasoned, conservative industry estimate for companies that buy strategic market intelligence.
3. Average first‑year price per customer (P_base) = £40,000 (reflects mix: single‑market packages ~£15k–35k, multi‑market ~£35k, full implementations £50k+; base is weighted average including initial setup/monitoring).
4. For TAM we assume every target company could purchase at least one package (annualized).
5. SAM penetration factor (product fit / realistic addressability) = 30% (companies active in multiple markets, strategic product teams — detailed ICP).
6. SOM (3‑year reachable share of SAM for Brilliant Noise) = 2% (reflects boutique consultancy global reach and sales resources).

Calculations (base)
- TAM_bottom = N_base × P_base = 3,000 × £40,000 = £120,000,000 / year
- SAM_bottom = TAM_bottom × 30% = £36,000,000 / year
- SOM_bottom = SAM_bottom × 2% = £720,000 / year (three‑year target level)

Bottom‑up sensitivity (±20% on two key levers: N and P)
- N low = 2,400; N high = 3,600
- P low = £32,000; P high = £48,000

Constructed bounds:
- TAM_low = 2,400 × £32,000 = £76.8M
- TAM_base = 3,000 × £40,000 = £120.0M
- TAM_high = 3,600 × £48,000 = £172.8M

Corresponding SAM (20–40% band) and SOM (1–4% band) can be derived from these ranges (I show consolidated sensitivity table below).

SECTION C — Top‑Down method (market category → auto share → product fit)

Assumptions & sources/logic
1. Comparable market: Global social listening / market intelligence / marketing analytics software market.
   - Best‑guess base market size: $4.5B (range $3.5B–$5.5B). This rough figure aligns with public market estimates for social media analytics / market intelligence combined in recent market reports (MarketsandMarkets / Grand View / industry summaries — used here as a reasoned industry benchmark).
2. Currency conversion: assume $1.25 = £1 (approx). So base market ≈ £3.6B (range £2.8B–£4.4B).
3. Automotive & motorcycle share of that market (auto demand for social/market intelligence vs. total): base 8% (range 6%–12%).
   - Rationale: Automotive is a high‑spending industry for marketing/insights but is one of many verticals (retail, CPG, finance, telecoms). 6–12% range captures uncertainty.
4. Product‑fit slice (percentage of that auto share that is addressable by Brilliant Noise’s Social Intelligence Dashboard — enterprise, multi‑market, product strategy focus): base 25% (range 15%–35%).
5. SOM (achievable share of SAM in 3 years): base 1% (range 0.5%–2%) — for boutique consultancy with enterprise sales cycles.

Calculations (base)
- Global market (GBP) base: £3.6B
- TAM_top = £3.6B × 8% = £288,000,000 / year
- SAM_top = TAM_top × 25% = £72,000,000 / year
- SOM_top = SAM_top × 1% = £720,000 / year

Top‑down sensitivity (vary global market ±20% and auto share ±20%)
- Market low = £2.8B; market high = £4.4B
- Auto share low = 6%; high = 12%

Selected bounds:
- TAM_low = £2.8B × 6% = £168M
- TAM_base = £3.6B × 8% = £288M
- TAM_high = £4.4B × 12% = £528M

SECTION D — Sensitivity table (key assumptions ±20%)

Bottom‑up sensitivity summary (TAM)
- N ±20% and P ±20% yields TAM range: £76.8M — £172.8M
Top‑down sensitivity summary (TAM)
- Market & vertical share ±20% yields TAM range: £168M — £528M

Consolidated (both methods)
- Combined plausible TAM range: ~£76M — £528M
- Narrowed realistic primary range (both methods overlap and judged realistic): £120M — £320M
  - Lower bound: bottom‑up conservative (£120M base)
  - Upper bound: top‑down with conservative vertical share (≈£320M is a practical trimmed upper bound within top‑down)

SECTION E — Final recommended TAM / SAM / SOM (base and ranges)

Base case (recommended numbers to use for planning)
- TAM (primary market, annual) = £120M — £288M (report both methods). For planning use midpoint ≈ £200M.
- SAM (serviceable given current product & ICP) = £36M (bottom‑up) — £72M (top‑down). Use conservative SAM = £36M for early GTM; scale up if product and sales resources expand.
- SOM (3‑year obtainable) = ~£720k / year (base) — this equals about 1–2% of SAM depending on method. This is realistic for a boutique consultancy with enterprise buyers unless you scale distribution/partnerships.

SECTION F — Interpretation / reconciliation
- Bottom‑up is conservative and reflects unit economics: a limited universe of 2–3k eligible buyers and current price points produce a TAM in low hundreds of millions of pounds.
- Top‑down suggests a larger potential if you count a broader “market intelligence” spend and more diffuse buyers (marketing teams across more firms). It produces a higher TAM but depends on broad market assumptions.
- Both methods yield the same order of magnitude: low‑to‑mid hundreds of millions GBP annually for the automotive & motorcycle vertical alone. For a boutique consultancy, the realistic near‑term SOM will be small (sub‑£1M) unless you scale productized offerings and recurring revenue.

SECTION G — 3 implications for go‑to‑market (practical)

1. Focus on high‑value pilot & subscription offers to increase LTV and accelerate SOM
   - Rationale: base SOM is small if you only sell one‑off projects. Introduce a clear pilot → annual monitoring subscription path (e.g., £25k pilot + £20k/yr monitoring) and a 12–24 month commitment to convert customers into recurring revenue. This raises obtainable revenue per client and improves conversion economics.

2. Prioritise a narrow beachhead buyer profile inside the SAM (global OEM product leads + Tier‑1 product strategy teams) and prove cross‑market case studies quickly
   - Rationale: SAM is much smaller if you require multi‑market capability and product‑strategy alignment. Close 3–6 flagship OEM deals with measurable “6 months early signal” ROI stories (estimate £500k+ avoided missteps) to unlock enterprise references and procurement pathways.

3. Build partnerships to expand distribution (research agencies, enterprise CRM/analytics vendors, consultancies)
   - Rationale: Top‑down shows a larger latent market, but Brilliant Noise alone will struggle to reach it quickly. Partnering with global consultancies, market‑research panels or technology platforms (CRM/MDM) lets you embed the dashboard into broader buying motions and capture a larger share of the £120–300M opportunity.

Appendix — Quick numbers recap (base)
- Bottom‑up base TAM = £120M; SAM = £36M; SOM = £0.72M
- Top‑down base TAM = £288M; SAM = £72M; SOM = £0.72M
- Recommended planning TAM range = £120M–£320M; conservative SAM = £36M; conservative SOM (3 yrs) ≈ £0.7M

If you want, next steps I can:
- Produce a 3‑year revenue forecast showing ARR build under different GTM scenarios (pure projects vs pilot+subscription vs channel partnership).
- Build a customer segmentation list and estimated counts (detailed company counts by OEM / Tier‑1 / motorcycle / aftermarket) that justify the bottom‑up N = 3,000 assumption.
