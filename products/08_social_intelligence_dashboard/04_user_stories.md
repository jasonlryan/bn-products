# Social Intelligence Dashboard • User Stories

Below are 9 user story cards for the Social Intelligence Dashboard. They are grouped by persona and journey stage. Each card follows the Agile format, contains 3–4 testable Acceptance Criteria, a Priority and clear Business Value focused on outcomes.

Persona: VP / Head of Product (Global OEM)
- Journey stage: Discovery
User story
As a VP/Head of Product, I want prioritized early-market consumer signals across my target markets, so that I can identify product opportunities and risks at least 6 months ahead and reduce costly late-stage design changes.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A prioritized list of the top 5 emerging consumer signals is delivered for each target market and is time-stamped with first-signal dates that indicate lead time ≥ 6 months compared to baseline historical indicators.
2. Each signal is supported by at least 5 independent, validated sources and a Confidence score (e.g., low/medium/high).
3. The output includes a short impact statement linking each signal to product implications (e.g., feature, spec, positioning) with an estimated risk/cost impact if ignored.
4. The Head of Product and two senior product stakeholders rate the signals’ usefulness ≥ 4/5 in a review session.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Enables strategic product decisions earlier, reducing the likelihood of late-stage reversals and associated costs (typical miscalculation impact).

- Journey stage: Evaluation
User story
As a VP/Head of Product evaluating new intelligence tools, I want a short pilot analysis that proves signal accuracy and relevance for one model line, so that I can decide confidently whether to scale the dashboard across other model lines.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A pilot report is produced for a chosen model line and market within the agreed pilot timeframe (e.g., 2–4 weeks).
2. The pilot links at least 3 identified signals to historical outcomes or comparable benchmark events, demonstrating predictive validity (e.g., similar signals preceded market shifts in prior cases).
3. Key stakeholders (Head of Product, Design Lead, Business Analyst) sign off that the pilot produced at least one actionable recommendation they would adopt.
4. The pilot includes clear provenance for each insight (sources, resonance score, date) and recommendations that can be operationalised in product planning.

Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Reduces procurement risk and increases confidence to invest in broader rollout by showing evidence the dashboard informs real product decisions.

Persona: Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
- Journey stage: Discovery
User story
As a CMO, I want to surface consumer preference shifts and channel resonance, so that I can reallocate marketing budget and adjust campaign focus to maximize ROI ahead of competitors.

Acceptance Criteria
1. The dashboard produces the top 3 consumer preference shifts per market with estimated audience size and growth trajectory within 10 business days.
2. Each shift includes recommended audience segments and the channels where resonance is highest, with supporting source evidence and a confidence score.
3. The marketing leadership team can produce a revised campaign allocation recommendation based on the insights within one planning cycle (e.g., two weeks).
4. Post-implementation, campaign KPIs (engagement, CTR, conversion) show measurable positive delta to prior baseline where applied, or the team documents expected targets for future measurement.

Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Helps direct marketing investment to where consumer demand is growing, improving campaign performance and optimising spend.

- Journey stage: Purchase (Business case)
User story
As a CMO preparing to request budget for the dashboard, I want a concise business case and executive-ready briefing pack, so that I can secure C-suite approval with projected ROI and risk reduction estimates.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A one-page executive brief and a 5–7 page business case are provided that clearly quantify expected benefits (e.g., reduced miscalculation risk, faster time-to-decision) and include at least one relevant case study.
2. The brief contains a conservative ROI estimate or range and an explanation of assumptions and sensitivity.
3. All C-suite reviewers report that they have sufficient information to make an approval decision (measured by an approval meeting outcome or stakeholder poll).
4. Finance and procurement sign off on the proposed commercial model and estimated payback period or provide feedback for revision.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Clears internal procurement hurdles and secures investment by translating insights into measurable business impact.

Persona: Chief Innovation Officer / CDO
- Journey stage: Evaluation
User story
As an Innovation Director/CDO, I want to compare and rank potential markets for expansion based on validated consumer signals, so that I can prioritise market entry where the probability of product-market fit is highest.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A ranked market scorecard is produced that compares at least 5 candidate markets against agreed strategic criteria (demand signal intensity, growth trajectory, competitive noise, regulatory risk).
2. Each market ranking includes the principal drivers and a confidence level derived from source coverage (minimum 20 validated sources per market).
3. The Innovation team can justify the recommended top 2 markets in the next governance meeting using the scorecard and receive stakeholder alignment.
4. The ranking methodology and weights are documented and adjustable so decisions are transparent and reproducible.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Increases the probability of successful market entry, avoiding costly misallocation of launch resources and shortening time to market.

Persona: Product Manager (Model Line / Feature Owner)
- Journey stage: Onboarding
User story
As a Product Manager, I want to quickly translate dashboard insights into validated problem hypotheses and recommended experiments, so that my team can run focused discovery sprints and reduce time-to-insight.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Within 5 business days of onboarding, the product team can identify at least one validated consumer need or pain point with supporting evidence and a suggested experiment (A/B test, survey, focus group).
2. The hypothesis includes estimated impact (qualitative or quantitative) and recommended success metrics for an experiment.
3. The cross-functional squad (design, research, engineering) accepts the hypothesis as the basis for the next sprint planning (documented sign-off).
4. The team is able to run an agreed lightweight experiment or discovery activity within the next sprint cycle using the insight.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Shortens discovery cycles, increases experiment relevance, and reduces wasted development effort on unvalidated assumptions.

- Journey stage: Success / Continuous Use
User story
As a Product Manager responsible for the roadmap, I want timely alerts when consumer signals shift materially against roadmap assumptions, so that I can reprioritise features before they become costly mistakes.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Alerts are generated for roadmap-impacting signal changes (severity high/medium/low) within 48 hours of the change crossing predefined thresholds.
2. Each alert includes the changed signal, supporting evidence links, impact rationale on affected roadmap items, and suggested mitigation or opportunity actions.
3. In user feedback sessions, Product Managers confirm alerts were actionable in ≥ 80% of reviewed cases during the quarter.
4. When an alert triggers a roadmap change, the change and the business rationale are recorded in the roadmap decision log.

Priority: Must Have
Business Value: Enables proactive roadmap management and reduces late-stage costly changes to product plans.

Persona: Market Intelligence Analyst / Insights Manager
- Journey stage: Onboarding / Evaluation
User story
As a Market Intelligence Analyst, I want to replicate validated market reports quickly across geographies using standard templates, so that I can scale insight output and reduce time spent preparing reports from weeks to days.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Using the standard template, an analyst can produce a full market intelligence report for a new market within 5 business days.
2. Each report contains at least 10 high‑confidence insights with provenance (≥ 3 corroborating sources per insight) and resonance scores.
3. Stakeholders (e.g., Product Manager, Head of Strategy) confirm the report meets decision-support needs in an initial review (rating ≥ 4/5).
4. The template and process include clear instructions for localising assumptions and documenting any data gaps.

Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Scales intelligence capability, reduces analyst overhead, and ensures comparable, repeatable outputs across markets.

Persona: Head of Strategic Planning / Strategy Lead
- Journey stage: Success / Measurement
User story
As Head of Strategic Planning, I want to measure and report the dashboard’s impact on business decisions and cost avoidance, so that I can justify continued investment and optimise how insights are used.

Acceptance Criteria
1. A quarterly impact report is produced that lists decisions influenced by the dashboard, estimated avoided miscalculation costs, and time-to-decision improvements, with at least one example validated by finance.
2. The report includes at least three KPIs (e.g., decisions influenced, estimated cost avoided, average time-to-decision) with baseline and current values.
3. Senior stakeholders confirm the report is a fair representation of impact (via sign-off or meeting consensus).
4. Recommendations for improving adoption or measurement are provided and prioritized.

Priority: Should Have
Business Value: Demonstrates measurable ROI, supports continued funding and helps refine adoption to maximise strategic outcomes.

If you’d like, I can:
- Convert these into JIRA-ready tickets with tags, estimate sizes and dependencies.
- Produce a condensed one-page roadmap that maps these stories to a 3-month delivery plan aligned with your Test-Learn-Lead™ methodology.
