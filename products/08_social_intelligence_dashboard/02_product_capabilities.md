# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Product Capabilities

Below is a sales‑enablement ready brief you can use when positioning Brilliant Noise’s Social Intelligence Dashboard with CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors and Product leads. It focuses on business outcomes and how the platform fits into buyer workflows.

1) Primary Capabilities (3–5, with business benefit)
- Early Market Signal Detection
  - What it does: Continuous monitoring and AI‑weighted signal scoring to surface rising consumer preferences and product attributes before competitors notice.
  - Business benefit: Spot market shifts up to ~6 months earlier — enabling proactive product moves, faster GTM adjustments and fewer costly missteps (typical avoided miscalculation ~£500K+).

- Competitive Intelligence & Benchmarking
  - What it does: Live, multi‑market competitive dashboard that benchmarks feature resonance, messaging, and share of voice across 50+ validated sources per market.
  - Business benefit: Make defensible positioning decisions and prioritise features that create measurable differentiation—reducing wasted feature investment and speeding time‑to‑value from launches.

- Consumer‑Validated Product Insight (Weighted Resonance Index)
  - What it does: Transforms social and public signals into a 20‑attribute Resonance Index to quantify what consumers actually value for each market segment.
  - Business benefit: Use consumer‑validated evidence in product prioritisation and roadmaps to increase launch success rates and reduce reliance on executive intuition.

- Actionable Strategic Recommendations & Monitoring
  - What it does: Packaged strategic recommendations, scenario options and ongoing alerts tied to client KPIs (market moves, competitive events, sentiment shifts).
  - Business benefit: Turns intelligence into decisions—shorter strategy cycles, faster approvals, and lower opportunity cost from delayed responses.

2) Delivery Method (how it works in practice)
- Kick‑off & alignment: Rapid onboarding workshop to set markets, competitor set, target segments and decision gates (typically 1–2 weeks).
- Data & validation: Ingest and validate signals from 50+ local sources per market; apply our Weighted Resonance Index to translate noise into signal.
- Insights & dashboards: Deliver an interactive competitive dashboard plus a market intelligence report with prioritized product and GTM recommendations.
- Strategic activation: Run an executive briefing and a hands‑on strategy session to convert recommendations into product roadmap or campaign actions.
- Ongoing monitoring & alerts: Continuous surveillance and monthly cadence reports + real‑time alerts for critical shifts; quarterly review to re‑calibrate priorities.
- Enablement & handover: Training for product/strategy teams and optional full implementation + advisory package to embed insights into decision processes.

3) Integration Points (with existing tools/processes)
- Product planning & roadmap tools: Feed prioritised insight into Aha!, Jira, or product gating processes to ensure consumer‑validated choices inform build decisions.
- Strategic planning & PMO: Integrates with monthly leadership reviews and investment committees to supply evidence for go/no‑go decisions.
- Marketing & comms stacks: Provide messaging inputs for campaign planning (Adobe, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, martech briefings) to align GTM to emerging consumer language.
- Analytics & BI: Exportable KPIs and exports for Tableau/Power BI, GA4, Snowflake so intelligence appears in existing executive dashboards.
- CRM & sales ops: Contextual signals for key accounts and territory strategies (Salesforce, HubSpot) to align product conversations with account needs.
- Collaboration & workflow: Alerts and summaries delivered into Slack/MS Teams and client ticketing or workflow platforms so insights become action items.
Note: All integrations are framed around delivering business outcomes (faster decisions, tighter alignment, measurable ROI) rather than technical lift.

4) Capability Roadmap (current vs 6‑month vision) — framed by business outcome
- Current (Today) — outcomes we deliver now

  - Weighted Resonance Index across 20 product attributes → outcome: quantifiable consumer preferences to inform roadmaps.
  - Strategic recommendations, monthly monitoring, executive briefings and training → outcome: immediate decision support and faster buy‑in.
  - Industry focus and playbooks for automotive & motorcycle sectors → outcome: faster relevance and less discovery time for clients.

- 6‑Month Vision — outcomes we will unlock
  - Predictive scenario modelling: produce 3‑6 month forecast scenarios tied to revenue/market share impact → outcome: deterministic business cases for investment decisions.
  - Automated alerting & decision playbooks: customizable triggers that push prescriptive next steps into client workflows → outcome: reduces response time and operationalises intelligence.
  - Deeper integrations with client toolchains (BI, roadmap tools, CRM) and API exports → outcome: intelligence flows automatically into governance and execution, shortening cycle times.
  - Scaled multi‑market orchestration: faster deployment to new markets with standardised local validation → outcome: lower time & cost to scale intelligence across regions.
  - Outcome‑based services: packaged SLAs and ROI metrics with advisory retainers (e.g., “reduce launch failure risk by X%”) → outcome: aligns our value with measurable client KPIs.

One‑line sales close (for pitches)
