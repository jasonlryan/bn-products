# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Demo Script

[0:00–0:10] Hook (10s)
"Imagine knowing a market shift six months before your nearest competitor — not a hunch, consumer‑validated certainty. That’s what you’ll see in the next three minutes."

[0:10–0:30] Context (20s)
"I’m from Brilliant Noise, a Brighton‑based AI innovation partner for global brands. We help CMOs and product leaders turn noisy social data into confident product and market decisions using our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach. Today I’ll show the Social Intelligence Dashboard — built for automotive and motorcycle teams planning expansion."

[0:30–1:50] Live Flow — 6–8 steps (80s)
1) [0:30–0:43] "Home screen — quick orientation: at the top you’ve got Markets, Competitors and the Weighted Resonance Index. (Spoken cue: ‘Watch this’ as I hover Markets.)"
2) [0:43–0:55] "Select three markets — UK, Germany, Mexico — and watch the dashboard align signals across all of them in one view. (Spoken cue: ‘Click Markets > Add UK, DE, MX’.)"
3) [0:55–1:07] "Signal feed — this is continuous AI‑ingested research from 50+ validated sources. We flag rising topics and give each a resonance score. (Spoken cue: ‘Scroll signal feed’.)"
4) [1:07–1:20] "Resonance Index detail — click any topic to see the 20 product attributes that drove the score: range, cost‑of‑ownership, styling cues, EV charging sentiment. (Spoken cue: ‘Open Resonance detail’.)"
5) [1:20–1:34] "Competitive compare — switch to Competitors and get side‑by‑side consumer signal maps and share of voice momentum. Spot which rival is losing traction before their next product launch. (Spoken cue: ‘Select Competitor A vs B’.)"
6) [1:34–1:47] "Forecast lens — the dashboard back‑tests signal trajectories. We surface which signals historically predict product success ~6 months out. (Spoken cue: ‘Show forecast overlay’.)"
7) [1:47–1:57] "Alerts & monitoring — set an alert and the system will ping your team when a signal crosses your risk/opportunity threshold. (Spoken cue: ‘Create alert: EV range concern > threshold’.)"
8) [1:57–1:50] "Recommendations pane — every insight comes with strategic next steps and confidence level that your team can action. (Spoken cue: ‘Open recommendations’.)"

(Note: keep flow brisk — each click demonstrates how data turns into clear decisions.)

[1:50–2:00] Wow Moment (10s)
"This dashboard turns social noise into a six‑month head start — a product roadmap’s early warning system."

[2:00–2:30] Objection Handling — 2 quick counters (30s)
1) Objection: "We already use social listening." Counter (15s): "Good — most tools surfacing chatter. Our difference is weighted, validated signals across 50+ sources and a Resonance Index that predicts behaviour, not just volume. It’s about signal quality, not just quantity."
2) Objection: "Sounds expensive / long to implement." Counter (15s): "We scale — a pilot market scan starts from £15k and delivers actionable intelligence in weeks. Full multi‑market rollouts and training follow your pacing and the Test‑Learn‑Lead™ rhythm."

[2:30–3:00] Call to Action (30s)
"If you’re a CMO or Head of Product in automotive/motorcycle markets, let’s book a 30‑minute tailored scan: one market, competitor snapshot and three strategic recommendations — proof of value in under four weeks. I’ll follow up to schedule, or if you prefer, we can set a two‑week pilot to show the six‑month signals on your categories. Which would you prefer — a quick scan or a pilot?"
