# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Qa Prep

1) What is the real market opportunity for Social Intelligence Dashboard?  
We target strategic product and marketing teams in global automotive and motorcycle OEMs and tier‑1 suppliers, a segment with multi‑billion euro annual spend on product strategy and market research where differentiated early signals are mission‑critical. Our initial TAM is enterprise customers in markets we serve, with clear expansion into adjacent industries and cross‑market monitoring upsells.  
Follow-up: I can send our TAM model and three-year revenue forecast — would you like that?

2) How do you prove demand and traction with enterprise buyers?  
We’ve closed pilots and paid engagements with global brands (e.g., adidas, BMW, Nestlé in adjacent briefs) and price entry engagements from £15k with multi‑market packages and multi‑year retainers demonstrating repeatable buyer behaviour. Pipeline conversion is driven by consultative pilots that map directly to product decisions, shortening procurement cycles.  
Follow-up: Want a redacted pipeline summary and recent case study showing conversion from pilot to retainer?

3) What is your revenue model and pricing logic?  
We sell a mix of one‑off market analysis engagements (from £15k), multi‑market packages (from £35k) and full implementations with training (from £50k+), combined with optional ongoing monitoring subscriptions for continuous intelligence. Pricing aligns to value delivered (decision avoided/made, estimated cost savings) and scales by market scope and integration depth.  
Follow-up: I can share our pricing playbook and value‑based sales collateral — shall I send it?

4) What are the unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback)?  
Our model targets enterprise LTV/CAC >3:1 by converting high‑value pilots into multi‑market retainers and upsells (monitoring + implementation), with deal economics driven by recurring monitoring margins and professional services for onboarding. We track payback via pilot conversion rates and aim for customer payback within the first 12 months of a multi‑market engagement.  
Follow-up: Would you like the anonymised customer cohort LTV/CAC and payback analysis?

5) What gross margins and scalability can investors expect?  
Professional services and bespoke implementation carry healthy project margins, while the monitoring subscription component scales with high incremental gross margins once the AI pipeline and dashboard are in place. Platformisation of our research pipeline and standardized weighted scoring materially increases margin and reduces marginal delivery costs over time.  
Follow-up: I can provide a margin bridge showing current vs. projected margins as we scale — interested?

6) What is your competitive moat versus consultancies and analytics vendors?  
Our moat is a hybrid of domain expertise (marketing + AI), a proprietary Weighted Resonance Index across 20 attributes, validated multi‑market source sets (50+ sources), and a Test‑Learn‑Lead™ delivery that embeds insights into client decision cycles, creating stickiness. That combination — not just raw dashboards — makes our output prescriptive and hard to replicate quickly.  
Follow-up: Want a one‑page comparison vs. top 5 competitors and where we win/lose?

7) How defensible is your data and signal quality?  
We back‑test signals against historical outcomes and curate source weights to prioritise predictive, consumer‑validated signals, with continual model retraining and human review to prevent drift. The combination of proprietary scoring, curated source lists, and industry templates creates repeatable quality that clients value for critical decisions.  
Follow-up: I can share a sample back‑test and our source validation checklist — shall I send it?

8) Do you have any IP or technical barriers to entry?  
We’ve codified our Weighted Resonance Index, signal weighting methodology and dashboard integrations as productised assets, and our operational playbooks and source taxonomies function as tacit IP that's costly for competitors to replicate. We also maintain engineering patterns and data pipelines that reduce rebuild time and increase switching friction.  
Follow-up: Would you like a short technical whitepaper summarising our scoring engine and integration architecture?

9) How do you handle data privacy, compliance and vendor risk (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?  
We process only public or client‑authorized data, apply anonymisation and aggregation, operate under GDPR principles, and execute DPAs and vendor assessments with clients to ensure compliance and legal defensibility. Privacy and security are core to our onboarding, and we can operate behind client firewalls or with approved data connectors where required.  
Follow-up: I can provide our GDPR statement, sample DPA and vendor security checklist — want those?

10) Who is the team that will scale this product and what are the hiring gaps?  
Founders and leadership bring 15+ years of digital transformation and AI application experience, complemented by senior researchers, data engineers and consultants experienced in automotive and consumer markets; key hiring focuses are sales leaders for enterprise expansion and senior ML ops engineers.  
Follow-up: Shall I share bios of the leadership team and the current hiring roadmap?

11) What is your go‑to‑market motion and how long is the sales cycle?  
We use a consultative GTM aimed at CMOs, CDOs and product leads combining targeted pilots, enterprise account selling, channel partnerships and thought leadership; sales cycles are typically 3–9 months depending on scope, shortened by value‑led pilots. Repeatable pilot → retainer funnels and partner co‑sell accelerate expansion.  
Follow-up: Interested in our GTM playbook and average pilot conversion metrics by ICP?

12) What are the biggest risks and your mitigation plans?  
Top risks are data source availability/model drift, competitive imitation, and elongated enterprise procurement; mitigations include diversified source sets and back‑testing, IP and operational playbooks to raise replication cost, and a pilot‑first sales model to demonstrate rapid ROI and accelerate procurement.  
Follow-up: I can share our risk register with mitigations and contingency plans — would you like to review it?
