# Social Intelligence Dashboard â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Product and strategy teams in automotive and motorcycle markets make highâ€‘cost decisions from fragmented social signals and competitive blind spots, causing missed market shifts and average miscalculations of Â£500K+. Existing tools surface noise, not validated product signals that predict consumer behaviour six months ahead.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- AIâ€‘powered research pipeline (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) that ingests 50+ validated sources per market to remove noise and surface early signals.
- Weighted Resonance Index scoring across 20 product attributes so teams can quantify what consumers actually care about and compare it across competitors and markets.
- Interactive competitive dashboard with realâ€‘time monitoring and alerting to spot market shifts ~6 months before peers and track impact over time.
- Deliverables: concise market intelligence reports, strategic recommendations grounded in consumerâ€‘validated data, and implementation + training for ongoing use across multiple markets.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
When the dashboardâ€™s Resonance Index for a specific feature spikes in Market Aâ€”six months before competitors actâ€”and the product team changes a spec with confidence because consumer signals and recommended actions align.

## Audience
- CMOs and CDOs at midâ€‘toâ€‘large automotive and motorcycle companies (â‰¥â‚¬50M revenue) planning market entry or expansion  
- Innovation Directors and Strategic Planning teams running multiâ€‘market roadmaps  
- Product Managers who need consumerâ€‘validated decisions to deâ€‘risk launches  
- Executive teams that must quantify competitive intelligence and forecast product demand

For brands that must move quickly across markets, this product turns social insight into reliable, operational decisions rather than speculative meetings.

## Positioning Statement
