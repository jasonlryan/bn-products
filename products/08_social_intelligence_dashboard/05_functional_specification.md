# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Functional Specification

1) Overview (what it does)
- Delivers validated, early market signals and competitive intelligence for automotive and motorcycle brands so product and strategy teams can make consumer‑backed decisions up to 6 months earlier than competitors.
- Packages continuous AI‑assisted research, a Weighted Resonance Index across 20 product attributes, and an interactive competitive dashboard into actionable strategic recommendations and monitoring capability.
- Purpose: reduce costly market miscalculations, accelerate go/no‑go decisions, and inform product-market fit and positioning.

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Client brief: target markets (3+ recommended for multi‑market product), target segments, product lines/models, and strategic questions.
- Access to client assets: brand/portfolio taxonomy, competitor list, historical sales or launch outcomes (if available).
- Prioritised product attributes and KPIs (or default 20 attribute framework).
- Legal/privacy constraints & any restricted sources per market.
- Stakeholder sponsors and decision cadence for insights consumption.

3) Core Process (step‑by‑step business flow)
- Onboard & align: confirm markets, objectives, attribute weights, and sources; set success KPIs.
- Source curation: assemble 50+ validated consumer, social, review, forum and media sources per market.
- Continuous signal capture: ingest public signals, conversations and content relevant to target attributes.
- Scoring & prioritisation: apply Weighted Resonance Index to quantify signal strength, momentum and consumer resonance across attributes and markets.
- Competitive mapping: benchmark brands, features, sentiment and share‑of‑voice trends; identify white‑space and threat vectors.
- Validation & forecasting: triangulate AI‑synthesised signals with historical patterns to produce 3–12 month directional forecasts.
- Strategic synthesis: convert insights into prioritized product recommendations, go‑to‑market actions and risk mitigations.
- Delivery & enablement: populate interactive dashboard, deliver market reports, run stakeholder workshops and train teams.
- Ongoing monitoring: continuous updates, alerts for emergent shifts, iterative tuning via Test‑Learn‑Lead™.

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Market Intelligence Report per market (initial + periodic updates): executive summary, forecasted shifts, ranked opportunities.
- Competitive Analysis Dashboard: interactive views of attribute scores, competitor gaps, sentiment and momentum.
- Strategic Recommendations: prioritized product/feature actions, launch timing guidance, pricing/positioning implications.
- Monitoring & Alerting: configurable alerts for emergent signals and competitor moves.
- Handover and Training: user training, playbook for decision workflows, and option for ongoing managed service.

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Early detection lead time: mean lead time to signal vs. competitors (target: ≥6 months).
- Decision impact: percentage of strategic/product decisions influenced by dashboard insights.
- Financial avoidance/gain: estimated avoided miscalculation cost or incremental revenue attributable to insight (target ROI within 12 months vs. price).
- Signal accuracy & actionability: client validation rate of top N recommendations (target ≥70% adoption/usefulness).
- Engagement: active user adoption and monthly dashboard usage by target stakeholders.
- Time‑to‑insight: time from question to actionable recommendation (target days, not weeks).

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Predictive uncertainty: signals are directional; not a substitute for controlled primary research where necessary.
- Coverage gaps: quality varies by market and language; niche channels may be under‑represented.
- Source dependency & legal limits: availability and permissibility of sources may change by region.
- Not an implementation service: delivers strategy and capability; full technical/system integration and custom engineering are out of scope unless contracted.
- Pricing tiers reflect depth: single‑market vs multi‑market and managed vs self‑serve options affect scope and timelines.
