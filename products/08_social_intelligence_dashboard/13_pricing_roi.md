# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Pricing Roi

Business Model Canvas (condensed)
- Key Partners: data providers (social APIs, local language vendors), AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), BI vendors (Tableau/Looker), automotive consultancies, channel partners in target markets.
- Key Activities: AI research pipeline, signal scoring (Resonance Index), dashboard engineering, market analysis reports, client workshops/training, monitoring & support.
- Key Resources: core analytics team (strategist, data scientist, developer), proprietary scoring IP, 50+ validated source library, cloud infra, sales/account team.
- Cost Structure: variable delivery labour, third‑party data & API costs, cloud & dashboard hosting, sales/marketing, product R&D. Estimated annual fixed product cost (dev/maint/marketing): £300k.
- Revenue Streams: one‑time product engagements (£15k / £35k / £50k+), implementation & training fees, monthly monitoring subscriptions, custom modelling & consulting retainers, licensing/white‑label.

Unit Economics (assumptions & numbers)
Assumptions (typical delivery)
- Blended labour rate: £85/hr. Single‑market delivery: 60 hrs. 3‑market delivery: 120 hrs. Full implementation: 200 hrs.
- Data & tools: single £1.5k; 3‑market £3.5k; full £5k. Overhead & PM: 30% of labour cost.

Per‑project unit costs
- Single‑market (Price £15,000): labour £5,100 + data £1,500 + infra £200 + overhead £1,530 = total cost £8,330. Gross profit £6,670 (margin 44%).
- Multi‑market (3+) (Price £35,000): labour £10,200 + data £3,500 + infra £500 + overhead £3,060 = cost £17,260. Gross profit £17,740 (margin 51%).
- Full implementation + training (Price £50,000): labour £17,000 + data £5,000 + training costs £3,000 + overhead £7,500 = cost £32,500. Gross profit £17,500 (margin 35%).

Breakeven (fixed annual cost £300k)
- Required sales mix to cover fixed costs (approx.):
  - Single‑market only: 300k / £6,670 ≈ 45 projects.
  - Multi‑market only: 300k / £17,740 ≈ 17 projects.
Actionable: prioritize multi‑market & subscriptions to lower volume required.

Pricing Strategy
- Model: tiered value‑based pricing (Standard single‑market £15k; Multi‑market £35k; Enterprise £50k+ with training & SLAs). Add modular subscriptions for monitoring (£2k–£4k/month per market).
- Justification: anchors to demonstrated value (average avoided miscalculation = £500k). Price represents 3–10% of a single avoidable mistake or <0.1% of mid‑sized OEM revenue — defensible for CMO/CDO buyers.
- Competitive positioning: premium boutique offering AI + strategic consulting — higher touch than pure SaaS, lower cost and more pragmatic than large consultancies.
- Price testing framework: A/B with three offers (base, value add, enterprise) across 20 pilot prospects; track MQL→SQL conversion, win rate, time‑to‑close. Target: 25% win on pilot price to validate.

Scalability Analysis
- Constraints: skilled analyst hours, manual data curation, bespoke dashboard builds.
- Path to scale: productize core pipeline (ETL + scoring), standardize dashboard templates, create self‑serve onboarding for monitoring subscriptions.
- Automation opportunities (12–18 months): automated ingestion & cleaning (reduce labour 60%→20%), auto‑scoring/resonance engine, templated slide/report generator. Expected effect: raise gross margins on single market from 44% → ~65% and cut delivery time 2–3x.

ROI Framework (client perspective)
Assumptions: client revenue £200M. Avoided miscalculation average impact £500k. Baseline uplift potential from better signals = 0.25% sales uplift = £500k/year.
- Conservative: single avoided miscalculation every 5 years = £100k/yr benefit.
- Base: avoided miscalculation every 3 years + 0.1% sales uplift = £(166k + 200k)=£366k/yr.
- Aggressive: 1 avoided miscalculation per year + 0.5% sales uplift = £(500k + 1,000k)=£1.5M/yr.
Payback period examples (multi‑market price £35k)
- Conservative: 35k / 100k = 0.35 years (~4 months).
- Base: 35k / 366k = 0.096 years (~35 days).
- Aggressive: 35k / 1.5M = 0.023 years (~8 days).
Value metrics to sell on: time‑to‑signal (6 months earlier), % reduction in launch reversals, revenue uplift, avoided cost per volatile decision.

Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell paths: annual monitoring subscription (£2–4k/month/market), custom predictive modelling (£25–75k), integration/API licensing (£10–30k), training/enablement days (£2k/day).
- Recurring revenue potential: converting 30% of buyers to monitoring (£24k/year) increases ARR materially.
- CLTV example (multi‑market buyer): initial £35k + 3 years monitoring (£24k/yr) + 1 upgrade (£30k) = £137k total revenue. Gross margin (avg 50%) → gross profit ≈ £68.5k. With 3‑year retention, CAC payback <6 months.
Actionable insights (top 5)
1. Focus GTM on multi‑market packages & enterprise pilots to hit breakeven faster.
2. Launch subscription monitoring (£2k–£4k/month/market) to convert project revenue into ARR.
3. Invest 6–12 months in automation (ETL + scoring) to lift margins to 60%+.
4. Use ROI case studies (conservative/base/aggressive) in sales decks to shorten procurement cycles.
5. Run price tests with 20 pilot customers to validate willingness and optimize packaging within 90 days.
