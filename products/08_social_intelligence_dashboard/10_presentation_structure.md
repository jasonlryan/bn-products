# Social Intelligence Dashboard • Presentation Structure

Presentation Playbook — Social Intelligence Dashboard
Audience: CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors, Product leads (automotive & motorcycle).

  - For hybrid/remote pitches, use video recording for demo backup and share link in chat.

5) Time Budgeting Scenarios & Transition Phrases
- 10‑minute intro meeting:
  - Use slides 1–4 + quick CTA (total 8–10 min). Transition phrase into CTA: “If this resonates, our fastest next step is a scoped pilot — here’s what that looks like.”
- 30‑minute standard meeting:
  - Slides 1–7 + 10 (20–25 min) + 5–10 Q&A.
  - Transition after demo: “That demo shows the capability — next I’ll show how others have converted this into measurable outcomes.”
- 60‑minute workshop:
  - Full core deck (25–30 min) + chosen deep‑dive (20–30 min) + Q&A/workshop (10–15 min).
- Smooth transition phrases (use conversationally):
  - Into problem → solution: “So that’s the issue — here’s our approach.”
  - Into demo: “I’ll switch to the dashboard — watch how [signal] appears and what we recommend.”
  - Into technical detail: “If you want to dig under the hood, here’s the architecture that delivers these insights.”
  - Into pricing: “All of this maps to pragmatic pricing — here are the options.”
  - Into closing: “What I’d propose next is a focused pilot to prove impact — shall we align on objectives?”

6) Quick Objection Responses (one‑liners)
- “We already have social listening”: “Most tools surface volume — we surface validated product signals and lead indicators, proven to correlate with outcomes.”
- “We can’t share data”: “We can run a pilot on public signals and sanitize any integrations; security/NDAs are standard.”
- “Too expensive”: “Consider cost vs even a single product miscalculation — our ROI scenarios show fast payback in many cases.”

7) Sales Assets Checklist (prep before meeting)
- Demo account scoped to prospect market(s)
- One‑page ROI sheet prefilled for prospect (use their estimated revenues)
- Case study relevant to automotive/motorcycle
- Technical spec + security datasheet (for technical meetings)
- Pilot proposal template (8–12 weeks) with price bands
- Slides exported as PDF + recorded demo link

Closing note
Keep the deck outcome‑centred, use the demo to show an immediate “aha” (a signal and recommended action), and follow with concrete next steps (pilot scope, timeline, sponsors). Tailor tone and depth per audience using the customization guide — executive = succinct outcomes, technical = validation, end‑user = actionable workflows.

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a fillable 30‑day pilot template for a specific market (e.g., UK motorcycle market).
- Build the one‑page ROI calculator prefilled with the prospect’s numbers.
Which would you prefer next?
