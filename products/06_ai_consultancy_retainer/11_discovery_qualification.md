# AI Consultancy Retainer • Discovery Qualification

Executive summary
- Purpose: A practical, repeatable discovery and qualification framework your sales team can use to qualify opportunities for the AI Consultancy Retainer quickly and consistently.
- Outcome: 10 focused discovery questions (mapped to BANT + MEDDIC), red flags that trigger disqualification, a numerical customer-fit scoring model (1–10 per dimension), and clear next-step playbooks by score band — all tailored to Brilliant Noise’s value prop (fractional Chief AI Officer, coaching, Test‑Learn‑Lead™ cadence) and target buyers (CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors, C‑suite at global brands).

SECTION A — 10 discovery questions (organized by BANT + MEDDIC)
Notes: For each question I include the mapped framework category, why it matters for the retainer, the “ideal” answer and a quick follow-up.

1) What business outcomes are you trying to achieve with AI in the next 6–18 months?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Metrics / BANT — Need & Timing  
- Why: Confirms measurable objectives (efficiency, revenue lift, speed to market). Our retainer sells to outcome-driven transformation, not tool pilots.  
- Ideal answer: Specific KPIs (e.g., 20% creative production cost reduction, 30% faster campaign launches, X% uplift in marketing ROI) with timebound target.  
- Follow-up: What baseline do you have for these KPIs today?

2) Who is the executive sponsor for enterprise AI and who would be the economic/decision owner for a retained AI partner?  
- Mapping: BANT — Authority / MEDDIC — Economic Buyer & Champion  
- Why: We need a clear sponsor and access to the economic buyer to secure commitment and unblock budgets.  
- Ideal answer: Named sponsor (CMO/CDO/Head of Innovation) plus confirmation they can influence or approve retainer-level spend.  
- Follow-up: Can we arrange a 30-minute briefing with the sponsor and the commercial approver?

3) What budget range or funding line is available for ongoing AI strategy and capability building this fiscal year?  
- Mapping: BANT — Budget / MEDDIC — Economic Buyer  
- Why: The retainer starts from ~£12k/month; we must know if funding exists for ongoing services (not a one-off project).  
- Ideal answer: Confirmed budget range or approval process for multi-month retainer; internal capex/opex rules.  
- Follow-up: Is budget already allocated or do we need to build a business case?

4) What internal capabilities and teams (data, engineering, martech, creative) will you make available to a retained advisor?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Identify Pain / BANT — Need  
- Why: Success requires cross-functional access and goodwill. If access is blocked, we cannot scale pilots.  
- Ideal answer: Commitment to provide product/marketing/data stakeholders and named leads for collaboration.  
- Follow-up: Can you share org chart or list of stakeholders we would regularly interact with?

5) What existing AI pilots or tools are in use, and which have stalled or failed to scale? Why?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Identify Pain / Metrics  
- Why: Reveals common failure modes (no governance, no capability, lack of runway) and opportunity for our Test‑Learn‑Lead approach.  
- Ideal answer: A few pilots with clear barriers listed (e.g., governance, skills, integration) and willingness to address them.  
- Follow-up: Which pilot had the most promise and what would success have looked like?

6) What criteria will you use to evaluate partners for this engagement? (e.g., senior advisory, price, references, ownership of outcomes)  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Decision Criteria  
- Why: Helps position Brilliant Noise’s differentiators (fractional CAIO, B‑Corp values, marketing transformation heritage).  
- Ideal answer: Prioritises senior strategic leadership, capability transfer, measurable outcomes over pure technical delivery.  
- Follow-up: Are references or case studies required, and what format do you prefer?

7) What is your decision-making process and timeline for selecting a retained AI partner? Who else needs to be involved?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Decision Process & BANT — Timing  
- Why: Clarifies timeline and required stakeholders — crucial for sequencing exec briefings and proposal deadlines.  
- Ideal answer: Clear steps (shortlist → exec briefing → commercial approval) and decision date within 30–90 days.  
- Follow-up: Can you map us onto that timeline and share any procurement constraints?

8) What internal governance or compliance rules (data residency, security, IP, vendor lists) would affect an ongoing retainer?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Decision Criteria / BANT — Need  
- Why: Legal/IT constraints can block engagement or require scope adjustments. Identify early.  
- Ideal answer: An honest list of constraints and a named contact in security/procurement who can work with us.  
- Follow-up: Are there approved contract templates or minimum insurance/certification requirements?

9) How will you measure success for a retained advisor after 3, 6 and 12 months? What would make you renew a retainer?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Metrics / Decision Criteria  
- Why: Ensures alignment on outcomes and renewability (we want multi-quarter engagements).  
- Ideal answer: Outcome KPIs and a renewal rubric (e.g., delivered ROI, capability uplift, adoption metrics).  
- Follow-up: Can we propose a 3‑month pilot success package that maps to those KPIs?

10) Is there an internal champion who will actively sponsor workshops, protect time, and drive change between teams? If so, who?  
- Mapping: MEDDIC — Champion / BANT — Authority  
- Why: A strong internal champion accelerates adoption and ensures retainer impact.  
- Ideal answer: Named senior sponsor who will advocate internally and enable cross-functional collaboration.  
- Follow-up: Ask the champion to join initial scoping workshop and a stakeholder alignment session.

SECTION B — Red flag indicators for disqualification (actionable triggers)
If you observe any of the following on a discovery call, consider pausing further pursuit or downgrade to nurture unless a mitigation plan is agreed.

1) No runway or budget for ongoing services (explicitly single‑pilot funding only).  
- Action: Disqualify for retainer. Offer a one-off paid workshop / assessment and nurture for future retainer.

2) Sponsor ambiguity, no identified economic buyer, or insistence on procurement-only interactions.  
- Action: If no senior sponsor within 30 days, deprioritise. Attempt one executive outreach; if no access, disqualify.

3) Tool-first mentality: prospect only wants to buy licences or a single implementation vendor.  
- Action: Not a fit — pass to partnerships or tool-integrator partners. Retainer sells capability & leadership.

4) Impossible timelines (expectation of enterprise-wide change in <3 months) without staged approach.  
- Action: Reset expectations with Test‑Learn‑Lead™. If customer refuses staged approach, disqualify.

5) No cross-functional access: security, data, or product teams refuse to engage.  
- Action: Disqualify until stakeholder access is committed in writing.

6) Compliance/legal barriers that cannot be met (e.g., forbids external advisors to touch production data).  
- Action: Disqualify or propose a scoped advisory engagement that excludes direct data access.

7) Preference for large management consultancies because of brand-orientation / “big firm” safety.  
- Action: If they cannot be convinced by case studies and references, deprioritise.

8) Expectation of guaranteed specific ROI within very short timeframe with refusal to agree shared success metrics.  
- Action: Disqualify or offer short paid discovery with clear outcome boundaries.

SECTION C — Ideal customer scoring criteria (1–10 scale per dimension)
Scoring approach: score each dimension 1–10 (1=very poor fit, 10=excellent fit). Sum = max 80. Use weightings to reflect criticality (weights shown). Provide rubric and examples of what each score band means.

Dimensions and weights
1) Strategic Fit (weight x1.5) — alignment to marketing transformation & enterprise-wide AI (scale 1–10)  
2) Budget & Funding Certainty (x1.3) — available ongoing budget for retainer (scale 1–10)  
3) Decision Authority & Sponsor Strength (x1.3) — named sponsor and economic buyer access (scale 1–10)  
4) Urgency / Timing (x1.1) — realistic, timebound decision & deployment window (scale 1–10)  
5) Data & Tech Readiness (x1.0) — maturity of martech, data access, integrations (scale 1–10)  
6) Capability & Cross‑Functional Access (x1.0) — willingness to commit teams (scale 1–10)  
7) Cultural & Values Fit (x0.8) — openness to boutique, values-based partner and Test‑Learn‑Lead™ (scale 1–10)  
8) Expected ROI / Impact Potential (x1.0) — scale of potential business impact (e.g., global campaign savings) (scale 1–10)

How to score quickly on a call
- Give a 1–3, 4–6, 7–10 rubric per dimension:
  - 7–10 (strong): Clear evidence (named sponsor, budget, KPIs, access).  
  - 4–6 (moderate): Some interest and partial commitments; missing one piece.  
  - 1–3 (weak): No budget, no sponsor, or fundamental blockers.

Example scoring conversion
- Raw max = (10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10) = 80. Weighted adjustments turn this into a composite prioritisation score for sales action. For simplicity, compute weighted sum and then normalise to 100 if desired.

Qualification bands (after weighted scoring)
- Strong fit (>=70/100): High priority — pursue immediately.  
- Good fit (50–69/100): Engage with structured pilot / scoping and align internal stakeholder commitments.  
- Marginal fit (30–49/100): Offer a small paid discovery or workshop; low priority for bespoke retainer now.  
- Not a fit (<30/100): Disqualify for retainer; move to nurture or alternative offerings.

SECTION D — Next steps playbook by qualification score
For each band include concrete actions, timelines, internal owners, and deliverables.

A) Strong fit (>=70/100) — Close path (High probability)

- Deliverable 1: Tailored retainer proposal including 3‑month success package, proposed retainer fee, milestones, and expected KPIs. (Prepare within 5 business days post-briefing).
- Deliverable 2: 3-month Test‑Learn‑Lead™ success plan (roadmap, governance model, required stakeholder time commitments, escalation points).
- Commercial: Recommend minimum 6-month engagement commitment; reference case studies and propose an outcomes-linked checkpoint at month 3.
- Contract/Procurement: Pre-empt security/compliance clause negotiation; request data access approvals early.
- Sales owner: Senior AE + Solutions Lead + CAIO for scoping call.
- Expected close timeline: 2–8 weeks.

B) Good fit (50–69/100) — Pilot/Narrow Retainer path (Medium probability)

- Deliverable: Discovery report with ROI model, recommended 90-day pilots, and a clear escalation plan for scaling to enterprise retainer.
- Stakeholder engagement: Secure champion commitment and at least one senior stakeholder to sponsor pilot execution.
- Commercial: Outline full retainer pricing and scaling pathway; include optionality to convert sprint into retainer credit.
- Sales owner: AE + Practice Lead; keep CAIO involved for scoping.
- Expected timeline: 4–12 weeks to conversion or fade.

C) Marginal fit (30–49/100) — Nurture / Low-cost entry (Low probability)
Actions:
- Offer: Short paid Diagnostic Workshop (1–2 days) or bespoke training session to build initial momentum (£8–15k), targeted at validating potential with minimal commitment.
- Deliverable: Workshop outcomes, 90-day recommendations, and a tailored capability uplift plan (no full retainer until further buy-in).
- Nurture plan: Quarterly check-ins; share relevant case studies, insights, and invite to webinars.
- Sales owner: AE (junior) with support from content team; hold periodic reviews.
- Expected timeline: 3–9 months to progress if KPIs and sponsor alignment improve.

D) Not a fit (<30/100) — Disqualify / Marketing nurture
Actions:
- Offer: Send relevant content, on-demand workshops, or invite to open innovation events. Propose a one‑off paid advisory if appropriate.
- Record reasons in CRM with follow-up date (6–12 months) and recommended next steps for conversion.
- If disqualified permanently, log in partner/redirect list (e.g., recommend local system integrators or tool vendors).
- Sales owner: SDR or AE for nurture path.

SECTION E — Call agenda & prep checklist (actionable)
Standard 45–60 minute discovery call agenda
1) 5m — Introductions and context (Brilliant Noise value prop + quick client intro).  
2) 20–30m — Use the 10 discovery questions; capture KPIs, sponsor, budget, blockers.  
3) 10m — Explain how the AI Consultancy Retainer maps to outcomes (fractional CAIO, coaching, Test‑Learn‑Lead) — tailor to responses.  
4) 10m — Next steps (confirm decision timeline, immediate actions, stakeholder meeting date).

Prep checklist before call
- Pull relevant case studies by industry (adidas, Nestlé examples).  
- Prepare a short 1‑pager of the 3‑month success package and retainer starting price.  
- CRM: pre-fill fields for scoring dimensions and leaves space for red-flag checkboxes.

SECTION F — Suggested CRM fields & automation
- Fields to capture: Sponsor name & role, economic buyer contact, budget range, decision timeline, top 3 KPIs, pilot history, data/security constraints, champion present (Y/N), initial score.  
- Automations: If score >=70 → auto-assign to Senior AE + CAIO and create exec-brief task; if red flag triggered → auto-schedule disqualification follow-up activity.

Final practical tips (closing)
- Lead with outcomes and governance: emphasize Test‑Learn‑Lead™ and fractional CAIO early.  
- Price anchoring: anchor on the strategic nature of retainer (from £12k/month) and show ROI examples scaled to client KPI.  
- Use champions: an internal champion who will protect time and unblock stakeholders is the single biggest predictor of retainer renewal.  
- Protect margins: insist on minimum engagement term and clear scope for included advisory hours vs. project work.

If you want, I can:
- Convert the scoring into a spreadsheet template with auto-calculation and recommended email templates for each next-step band.  
- Draft the 3-month success package template aligned to the “Strong fit” playbook.
