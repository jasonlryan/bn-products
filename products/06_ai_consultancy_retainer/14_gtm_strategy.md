# AI Consultancy Retainer • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — AI Consultancy Retainer
Audience: Brilliant Noise leadership (CEO, Head of Growth, Head of Delivery), Sales, Marketing, People Ops, Partnerships, Delivery Leads.
Purpose: Practical, time‑bound plan to grow the AI Consultancy Retainer from current capacity to 10x revenue, including channel strategy, operational model, hiring, milestones, KPIs and concrete actions.

Notes & key assumptions (call these out up front)
- Baseline (example): current active retainers = 12; average revenue = £18k/month/client → ARR ≈ £2.6M. If your actual baseline differs, replace numbers and timelines proportionally.
- Base retainer price: from £12k/month; average used = £18k/month to reflect scope variation and upsells.
- Delivery capacity model: one senior AI strategist (fractional Chief AI Officer) will manage ~4 concurrent retainers at this level (high-touch, C-suite advisory + coaching). This is the principal capacity constraint.
- Support ratios (for scale): per 1 senior AI strategist expect ~1 mid-level AI strategist, ~1 capability coach, 0.5 prompt/automation engineer, 0.5 delivery/project manager (shared). These ratios balance high touch and scale.
- Target timescale to 10x: 36–48 months (aggressive but achievable with hiring, productization and strong partnerships).
- Adjust hires/pricing if you aim for faster or slower growth.

Structure: three phases (Launch 0–6m, Scale 6–24m, Expand 24–48m). Each section contains tactical action items, owners, timelines, KPIs.

1) Channel Strategy — primary & secondary channels (with rationale)
Primary channels (focus and investments)
- Enterprise Direct Sales / Account-Based Marketing (ABM)
  - Rationale: target buyers are CMOs/CDOs/Innovation Directors at large global brands; long enterprise sales cycles but highest ACV; fits boutique high-touch positioning.
  - Channel activities: dedicated AE + SDR teams, targeted outreach, executive briefings, enterprise RFP play, tailored case studies.
- Strategic Partnerships (global agency partners, system integrators, cloud/AI vendors)
  - Rationale: accelerates credibility, co-sell opportunities, and pipeline from existing vendor/agency relationships; opens enterprise doors.
  - Focus partners: creative agency partners (global networks), AWS/Google Cloud/Microsoft, OpenAI/Anthropic reseller or ISV partnerships, specialist SI partners for implementation when needed.
- Executive Events & Thought Leadership (roundtables, private dinners, industry events)
  - Rationale: builds trust with CMOs and C-suite; showcases Test-Learn-Lead™ and fractional CAIO capability.
  - Activities: invite-only roundtables, CXO dinners, sponsored panels at marketing conferences.

Secondary channels (lower investment, scalable)
- Content + LinkedIn Demand Gen
  - Rationale: steady inbound and reputation-building; supports ABM.
- Productized Workshops & Webinars (paid & free pilots)
  - Rationale: scalable entry points that convert to retainers.
- Referral & Client Success Program
  - Rationale: existing global clients are highly credible sources for introductions.
- Paid social (LinkedIn) and targeted PR
  - Rationale: supports visibility for new offerings, case studies and hiring.

Action items (30–90 days)
- Build ABM lists for top 200 target accounts (Sales/Marketing). Owner: Head of Growth / SDR Lead. Deadline: 45 days.
- Draft partner target list and partnership one-pager (Partnerships Lead). Deadline: 30 days.
- Calendar 4 executive roundtables for next 6 months (Events + Head of Growth). Deadline: 60 days.

2) Scalability Roadmap — from current capacity to 10x revenue
High-level revenue & headcount model (example)
- Baseline: 12 clients → ARR ≈ £2.6M.
- 10x target: ARR ≈ £26M → ~120 clients at current avg price.
- Senior strategists required: 120 clients / 4 clients per senior = 30 senior AI strategists.
- Support staff (ratios): 30 mid AI strategists, 30 capability coaches, 15 prompt engineers, 15 delivery PMs.
- Central ops & GTM: Sales (10–15 AEs), SDRs (6–10), Marketing (6–8), Partnerships (3–5), People Ops and Finance scale.

Phases & milestones
- Phase A — 0–6 months (productise, proof, ramp demand)
  - Targets: +8 clients (total ~20); hire 2 senior AI strategists; create 3 vertical playbooks.
  - Actions: run ABM pilot, establish 2 strategic partnerships, launch paid workshop product.
- Phase B — 6–18 months (systematise delivery & ramp sales)
  - Targets: 20 → 50 clients; hire additional 8–10 senior strategists; launch LMS + prompt library productisation.
  - Actions: open regional sales coverage (US/EMEA), build partner co-sell programs, double ABM/Content investment.
- Phase C — 18–36 months (scale engine & enterprise penetration)
  - Targets: 50 → 120 clients; hire remaining 20 senior strategists; scale partnerships and automation; introduce self‑serve product tiers for lower ACV.
  - Actions: establish delivery pods, regional hubs, and run multi‑partner global deals.

Capacity constraints & mitigations
- Constraint: senior strategist scarcity. Mitigations: build fractional model (0.25–0.5 FTE per client), hire experienced strategists early, create rapid upskilling program (internal apprenticeship), and productize repeatable work to shift load to mid-level staff.
- Constraint: onboarding & knowledge transfer. Mitigations: standardised onboarding playbook, client-facing LMS, and task automation (contracts, billing).
- Constraint: long enterprise sales cycles. Mitigations: pre-seed engagements (workshops), pilot-to-retainer conversion flows, partner referrals.

KPIs & targets (example)
- Pipeline coverage: 6–8x booking target.
- Conversion rate: workshop → retainer 20–30% (improve to 35% with ABM + case studies).
- Average clients per senior strategist: maintain 4 (target 4–5 as productised).
- Customer NPS ≥ 60; retention churn <10% annually.

Risks & mitigation (brief)
- Risk: inability to hire senior strategists fast enough. Mitigation: invest in training/apprenticeship, hire strong mid-levels and mentor, offer attractive fractional packages.
- Risk: commoditisation and pricing pressure. Mitigation: maintain differentiation (fractional CAIO, Test-Learn-Lead™, B-Corp values), productize IP and increase recurring non‑headcount revenue.
- Risk: slow enterprise procurement. Mitigation: use paid pilots, workshops, and partner introductions to shorten cycles.

KPIs dashboard (what to track monthly)
- ARR and new bookings (by tier)
- Active retainers, churn rate, NPS
- Average deal cycle length and conversion rates (workshop→retainer)
- Clients per senior strategist (utilisation)
- Pipeline value and coverage ratio
- Partner-sourced pipeline & closed revenue
- Content engagement (downloads, webinar attendees, LinkedIn engagement)

Appendix — Example 12-month milestone calendar (high-level)
- Month 0–3: Finalise delivery playbook / hire 2 senior strategists / ABM pilot / 2 strategic partnerships / publish case studies.
- Month 4–6: Close +8 clients via ABM & workshops / launch paid productised workshops / build client health dashboard / start LMS MVP.
- Month 7–12: Hire +8 senior strategists; scale ABM; launch prompt library beta to clients; secure 3 enterprise retainers (£35k+ p/m); launch regional outreach US.
- End of Year 1 target: 50 clients (ARR ≈ £9M) — adjust based on actual conversion; if under-target, double down on partnerships and productized offers.

Final recommendations (executive)
1. Prioritise ABM + partnerships: they will produce highest ACV clients and speed enterprise entry.
2. Invest early in productisation (prompt library, playbooks, LMS): this increases gross margins and reduces dependency on senior strategist headcount growth.
3. Build hiring & apprenticeship pipeline now: senior strategists are the main bottleneck; build internal training to multiply capability.
4. Measure relentlessly: standardised KPIs, client health and NPS must be live in 60–90 days to manage scale effectively.
5. Preserve brand differentiation (B‑Corp, marketing transformation heritage, Test-Learn-Lead™): use it in every piece of content, pitch and partner dialogue.

If you want, I can:
- Convert this into a Gantt-style 36-month implementation timeline with role-by-role hiring roadmaps and monthly KPI targets specific to your actual baseline numbers.
- Produce templated ABM sequences, partner one‑pager & MOU, and a retainer SOW + pricing sheet tailored to Brilliant Noise’s tone and credentials. Which would you prefer next?
