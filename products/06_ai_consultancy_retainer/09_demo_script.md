Hook — 0:10
(0:00–0:10) “Imagine your marketing team turning AI pilots into consistent, measurable growth every quarter — not a one-off proof of concept, but sustained capability across the business. That’s what we do.”

Context — 0:20
(0:10–0:30) “Hi, I’m [Name] from Brilliant Noise — a Brighton‑based, B‑Corp digital consultancy founded in 2009. We help global brands like adidas and Nestlé move from experiments to organisation‑wide AI impact using our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach. This is for CMOs and CDOs ready to invest in long‑term transformation, not just tools.”

(0:30–1:50)
1) Kickoff & alignment — 0:10

4) Coaching & playbooks — 0:12
   (Say: “Here’s the prompt library and role play.”) “Weekly 1:1 coaching plus group sessions and reusable playbooks to lift team capability fast.”

5) Productisation & wrap to scale — 0:12
   (Say: “How do we industrialise this?”) “We convert successful pilots into repeatable processes — templates, APIs and governance for safe, reliable roll‑out.”

6) Governance & risk management — 0:12
   (Say: “Who owns model risk and data use?”) “We set up decision rights, ethical guardrails and an operating cadence so compliance is a business enabler, not a blocker.”

- “It sounds expensive.” — 0:10
  (Say: “What return do you need?”) “From £12k/month, clients recoup through faster campaigns, automation and better decisions — we target measurable ROI in the first 3–6 months.”

- “We already have an internal team.” — 0:10
  (Say: “We’re here to amplify, not replace.”) “We embed with your team via coaching and hand‑offs so you keep IP and accelerate capability transfer.”

Call to Action — 0:40
(2:20–3:00) “If you’re a CMO, CDO or Innovation Lead ready to move beyond pilots, book a 30‑minute Strategy Sprint with our senior AI lead. We’ll run a quick diagnostic, outline a 90‑day Test‑Learn plan tailored to your top KPI, and show where £12k/month scales to real business outcomes. Tell me when you’re free this week, and we’ll send a short pre‑read so the session is high‑value from minute one.”
