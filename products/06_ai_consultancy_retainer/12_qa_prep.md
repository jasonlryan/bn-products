# AI Consultancy Retainer • Qa Prep

1) What is the market opportunity for an AI consultancy retainer focused on global marketing transformation?  
Answer: The market is large and growing — global enterprise marketing transformation and AI advisory for large brands represents a multi‑billion pound SAM driven by AI adoption and marketing tech spend, with increasing budgets shifting from point tools to retained strategic capability.  
Follow-up: I can share a short TAM/SAM/SOM slide and our target segment sizing.

2) How sustainable is your moat versus Big Four consultancies and specialised implementers?  
Answer: Our moat is practical domain expertise — a blend of deep, marketing‑first AI know‑how, proprietary Test‑Learn‑Lead™ playbooks, long‑standing brand relationships and B‑Corp positioning that larger firms struggle to replicate quickly.  
Follow-up: I can send three case studies showing how our approach outpaced both generalist consultancies and pure tech implementers.

3) Why will clients pay a monthly retainer rather than one‑off projects or buying tools?  
Answer: Clients buy retained senior strategy, continuous capability building and operational cadence that convert pilots into sustained ROI — outcomes that one‑off projects or tools alone consistently fail to deliver.  
Follow-up: I can provide sample retainer SOWs and client testimonials demonstrating realized ROI over 12 months.

4) What are the unit economics — margins, ARPU, CAC and payback?  
Answer: Typical retainer ARPU is £12k–£40k/month with gross margins in the ~55–70% range; our enterprise sales CAC payback is generally 6–12 months and LTV/CAC comfortably above 3x for mature accounts.  
Follow-up: I can share anonymised cohort P&L and CAC/LTV schedules.

5) How do you scale delivery without diluting seniority and quality?  
Answer: We scale via a hub-and-spoke model: senior fractional strategists lead client engagements supported by trained delivery squads, repeatable playbooks and a centralized prompt/IP library to preserve quality while expanding capacity.  
Follow-up: I can walk you through our org chart and staffing model for a 20–50 client footprint.

6) Do you have client concentration risk given several marquee global brands?  
Answer: We work with multiple large brands but run account diversification targets and a balanced pipeline; marquee clients validate the model and drive referrals, while contracting and multi‑practice delivery reduce single‑account dependency.  
Follow-up: I can provide our current client revenue split and concentration mitigation plan.

7) How strong is the founding and delivery team to execute an enterprise AI advisory practice?  
Answer: Founded in 2009 by experienced digital leaders, our leadership has 15+ years in transformation and demonstrated delivery at adidas, Nestlé and others, supported by senior AI strategists with industry experience.  
Follow-up: I can send CEO/founder and senior strategist bios plus recent client reference contacts.

8) What is your go‑to‑market motion and sales cycle for landing these retainers?  
Answer: We use an enterprise ABM motion targeting CMOs/CDOs via executive briefings, proof‑of‑value pilots and referrals, with a typical sales cycle of 3–9 months depending on governance complexity.  
Follow-up: I can share our pipeline funnel metrics, conversion rates and typical pilot→retainer conversion examples.

9) How do you defend against fast‑moving competitive threats, including AI platform vendors?  
Answer: We differentiate by owning strategy, change management and capability — vendor partners lack our marketing context and long‑term coaching model, while our embedded playbooks and staff training create switching costs.  
Follow-up: I can map our competitive landscape and show win/loss analyses.

10) Who owns model IP and how do you handle client data, privacy and compliance?  
Answer: Clients retain ownership of their data and any custom models we build under contract; we operate under enterprise DPAs, contextualise processing within client security stacks (VPC/onsite), and follow GDPR and best‑practice data governance.  
Follow-up: I can provide our standard DPA, security checklist and a redacted SOC/controls summary.

11) How do you quantify and guarantee the ROI clients expect from a retainer?  
Answer: We set measurable KPIs at engagement outset (e.g., % productivity improvement, campaign lift, time‑to‑market) and run quarterly value reviews tied to roadmap priorities, with performance‑linked scope adjustments rather than blanket guarantees.  
Follow-up: I can share sample KPI dashboards and a recent client ROI report.

12) What are the biggest operational and regulatory risks (model bias, hallucinations, changing AI rules) and how do you mitigate them?  
Answer: Key risks are model misuse, bias and evolving regulation; we mitigate via model governance frameworks, human‑in‑the‑loop validation, bias testing, documented prompt safety, and continuous legal and compliance reviews for each client.  
Follow-up: I can send our model governance playbook and an example risk‑remediation log.
