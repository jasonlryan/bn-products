# AI Consultancy Retainer • Functional Specification

1) Overview (what it does)
- Ongoing senior AI strategy and capability-building service that moves organisations from isolated pilots to measurable, organisation-wide impact.
- Provides fractional Chief AI Officer expertise, customised coaching, innovation support and a governance cadence to accelerate adoption, mitigate risk and embed repeatable AI capability using Brilliant Noise’s Test‑Learn‑Lead™ methodology.
- Commercial model: monthly retainer (from £12,000/month), scalable by scope and seniority.

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
- Executive objectives and priority use-cases (top 3–5 business goals tied to revenue, cost, customer or time-to-market metrics).
- Current AI/automation inventory: pilots, vendors, data sources, integrations, tech constraints.
- Organisational map: decision-makers, functional owners, change sponsors, operating model.
- Access to key stakeholders and working teams for interviews and workshops.
- Baseline performance metrics/KPIs and budget/time horizons.
- Legal, compliance and data-governance constraints.

3) Core Process (step-by-step how it works)
- Onboard & Align (weeks 0–2): confirm scope, stakeholders, success criteria; schedule cadence and governance rituals.
- Discover & Baseline (weeks 1–4): rapid assessment of capabilities, portfolio, risks and opportunity sizing; stakeholder interviews and technical/operational diagnostics.
- Strategy & Roadmap (weeks 3–6): prioritised portfolio (pilots → scale), resource plan, ROI cases, operating model and governance recommendations.
- Pilot Enable & Coach (ongoing): design/validate experiments, provide hands-on senior advisory, run sprints, deliver prompt libraries and playbooks, coach teams 1:1 and in groups.
- Scale & Embed (months 3+): institutionalise repeatable patterns (templates, governance, upskilling programmes), transition ownership to client teams.
- Govern, Measure & Iterate (continuous): monthly retainer cadence—reviews, KPI reporting, risk mitigation, proactive strategic recommendations; quarterly re-prioritisation.

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Fractional Chief AI Officer time (defined hours) and named senior strategist access.
- Strategic AI roadmap with prioritised business cases and ROI estimates.
- Pilot designs, success criteria and execution playbooks (including prompt libraries, experiment templates).
- Capability-building: customised coaching sessions, training curricula, group workshops and certification plan.
- Governance & operating model artifacts: roles, RACI, policies and vendor management guidance.
- Monthly performance reports, KPI dashboard and quarterly executive briefings.
- Change management pack and transition plan for sustained ownership.

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Business outcomes: realised revenue uplift, cost savings or time-to-market improvements versus baseline targets.
- Adoption metrics: number of scaled pilots, percentage of targeted teams using AI in workflows, active users.
- Productivity signals: measured efficiency gains (hours saved, tasks automated).
- Capability metrics: staff trained/certified, internal AI champions established, reduction in external dependency.
- Speed: time-to-value for priority use-cases (targeted SLAs).
- Stakeholder satisfaction and ongoing executive sponsorship.

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Advisory-first scope: retainer focuses on strategy, coaching and enablement; large-scale engineering build or vendor implementation may require separate contracts.
- Dependent on client commitment: outcomes require executive sponsorship, cross-functional time, and data access.
- Data, legal and regulatory barriers may delay or limit certain interventions.
- Results influenced by external market and vendor changes; no guaranteed product-level performance.
- Budget and timebox constraints will prioritise certain initiatives over others; retainer not a substitute for capital investment in platforms where needed.
