# AI Consultancy Retainer • Pricing Roi

Below is a compact, numbers‑driven business model and pricing analysis for Brilliant Noise’s AI Consultancy Retainer. All figures are illustrative but grounded in realistic consultancy economics for global‑brand clients.

Business Model Canvas (focused)
- Key partners: enterprise buyers (CMO/CDO), AI platform vendors (OpenAI, Azure), training partners, freelance senior AI strategists, legal/compliance advisors.
- Key activities: fractional CAIO advisory, coaching, pilot design, capability building, playbook development, stakeholder governance.
- Key resources: senior AI strategists, consultants (junior/mid), IP (playbooks, prompt libraries), training platform, sales/account team.
- Cost structure: variable delivery costs (people time, platform licences, travel) + fixed costs (BD, product ops, office, IP dev). Example mix: 60% people, 10% tech, 30% fixed/overhead.
- Revenue streams: monthly retainer (from £12,000/mo), project/implementation uplift, training seat fees, premium advisory days, platform/licence referrals.

Unit Economics (per baseline retainer @ £12,000/month)
- Assumptions (per-month): senior strategist 0.3 FTE cost (fully loaded) £6,000; junior support 0.4 FTE £2,000; tools/licenses £500; travel/expenses £500; variable total = £9,000? — revise to realistic: variable total = £6,000 (senior £4,500 + junior £1,200 + tools £300).
- Contribution margin: price £12,000 − variable cost £6,000 = £6,000 (50% contribution margin).
- Fixed annual product-line cost: £240,000 (BD, product, ops). Breakeven retainers = fixed / (annual contribution per retainer) = 240k / (6k*12) = 3.33 → require 4 active retainers to breakeven.
- CAC assumption: £30,000 (targeted enterprise sales). Payback on CAC = CAC / monthly contribution = 30k / 6k = 5 months.

Pricing Strategy
- Tiered model (value‑based):
  - Starter: £12k/mo — fractional CAIO, 8 coaching hours, roadmap.
  - Growth: £20k/mo — more senior time, monthly pilots, governance set-up.
  - Enterprise: £35k+ /mo — dedicated senior team, cross‑region rollout, custom KPIs.
- Justification: price anchored to ROI delivered (marketing efficiency, speed, risk reduction) and scarcity of senior AI talent; boutique, B‑Corp premium positioning vs Big4.
- Competitive positioning: premium boutique specialist (higher touch than niche vendors, more practical than large strategy firms).
- Price testing framework: run randomized offers across similar ICPs (Pilot discount vs full price), track 6‑month conversion, acceptance threshold: >40% of pilots convert to paid retainers at >£12k. Use WTP surveys and win/loss interviews quarterly; iterate tiers and add value‑metric bundles.

Scalability Analysis
- Capacity constraints: senior strategist time is primary bottleneck. With current staffing, one senior can serve ~6–8 Starter retainers (0.12–0.2 FTE each) or 2–3 Enterprise.
- Path to scale:
  - Productize core playbooks and templates to reduce bespoke time.
  - Build a vetted senior consultant pool (fractional staffing) to expand capacity quickly.
  - Create partner network for implementation (reduce delivery burden).
- Automation opportunities:
  - Prompt libraries, auto‑reports, and LLM‑assisted prep can reduce junior hours by ~30%, lowering variable cost from £6k to ~£4.5k and increasing contribution margin from 50% to ~63%.

ROI Framework (customer view)
Assumptions: target client marketing budget £10M; baseline annual retainer cost £144k (12×£12k).

- Conservative scenario:
  - Efficiency gain 2% → annual savings = £200k.
  - Net benefit = savings − retainer = £56k. ROI = 39% (net benefit/retainer). Payback = retainer / (savings/12) = 144k / 16.7k ≈ 8.6 months.
- Expected scenario:
  - Efficiency gain 5% → savings = £500k.
  - Net benefit = £356k. ROI = 247%. Payback = 144k / (41.7k) ≈ 3.5 months.
- Aggressive scenario:
  - Efficiency gain 10% → savings = £1,000k.
  - Net benefit = £856k. ROI = 594%. Payback ≈ 1.7 months.
- Value metrics to track: % reduction in creative production cost, % faster time‑to‑market, earned media uplift, internal projects moved to production, training adoption rate.

Revenue Expansion & CLTV
- Upsell opportunities: implementation projects (£50–250k one‑offs), model engineering & MLOps, seat-based training (£500–2,000/seat/mo), analytics dashboards, subscription to managed model monitoring.
- Recurring potential: add‑on subscriptions (monitoring, prompt library) could add £2–8k/mo per client.
- CLTV example:
  - Contribution = £6k/mo; avg retention = 24 months → contribution lifetime = £144k. Subtract CAC £30k → LTV ≈ £114k.
  - With modest upsell (+£3k/mo from month 6), LTV increases to ~£198k.
Actionable insights
- Target launch with 4–6 pilot retainers to hit product‑line breakeven quickly.
- Invest in automation (reporting + prompt libraries) to lift margins and reduce senior time.
- Use value‑based selling: quantify likely client savings during pitch to justify £12k+ price and shorten procurement.
- Measure conversion from pilot → retainer and aim for >40% within 6 months; adjust tier structure if conversion <30%.
