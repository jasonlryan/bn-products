# AI Consultancy Retainer • Executive Positioning

## 🎯 Problem
Global brands run isolated AI pilots that never scale because they lack sustained senior AI strategy, hands‑on coaching, and an operating cadence to turn experiments into measurable business outcomes. That knowledge bottleneck wastes budget, slows productisation, and leaves marketing and product teams unable to embed AI into daily decision-making.

## 💡 Solution
- Fractional Chief AI Officer access on retainer (senior strategist who owns roadmaps, governance and stakeholder alignment) to remove strategic black holes and accelerate decisions.  
- Customized 1:1 coaching and group capability sessions that embed Test‑Learn‑Lead™ playbooks, prompt libraries and repeatable pilot templates into existing teams.  
- Ongoing innovation support: monthly strategic reviews, proactive recommendations, pilot-to-scale blueprints and KPI tracking so experiments convert to measurable productivity gains.  
- Practical assets and tooling (prompt libraries, governance checklists, pilot scorecards) plus hands-on support to hand over a working, maintainable capability rather than a one‑off PoC.

## ✨ Magic Moment
When the leadership team watches a two‑week pilot move from prototype to a repeatable workflow under our fractional CAIO — showing a tracked uplift in efficiency on the business dashboard and an agreed roadmap for scale — the conversation stops being “if” and becomes “how fast.”

## Audience
- CMOs and Marketing Leadership at global brands seeking measurable AI-driven performance  
- Chief Digital/Innovation Officers and Transformation leads needing to scale pilots into capability  
- C-suite executives committed to long-term AI investment beyond point solutions  
- Internal capability owners responsible for upskilling teams and embedding AI processes  
- Established enterprises that require governance, risk controls and commercial rigor around AI
