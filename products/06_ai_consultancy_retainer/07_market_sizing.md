# AI Consultancy Retainer • Market Sizing

Below is a structured TAM (Total Addressable Market) analysis for Brilliant Noise’s AI Consultancy Retainer. I show both a Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up approach, the formulas used, all core assumptions (and reasoning/sources where available), a reconciled TAM with SAM and SOM, a sensitivity analysis (±20% on key assumptions), and three GTM implications.

Executive summary (quick):
- Top‑Down estimate: ~£0.8B annual market for marketing‑focused, retainer‑style AI strategy services.
- Bottom‑Up estimate: ~£2.4B annual market (target global enterprises × average annual retainer).
- Reconciled/base-case TAM (midpoint): ~£1.6B.
- Base-case SAM (serviceable, addressable): ~40% of TAM = £640M.
- Base-case SOM (serviceable obtainable; 0.5% of SAM within 3–5 years): ~£3.2M (range £1.3M–£12.8M depending on ambition).
- Sensitivity (±20%) and implications follow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Definitions and formulas
- TAM (Total Addressable Market) = total annual dollars that could be spent worldwide on the product/service if every potential buyer bought it.
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) = portion of TAM that fits Brilliant Noise’s target geography, industries and positioning.
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) = portion of SAM realistic to win in a given timeframe (e.g., 3–5 years).

Key formulas:
- Bottom‑Up TAM = (Number of target enterprises) × (Average annual retainer price)
- Top‑Down TAM = (Total consulting/tech/digital market) × (% for digital transformation) × (% for AI services) × (% for strategic/retainer style) × (% relevant to marketing)
- SAM = TAM × (Serviceable %)
- SOM = SAM × (Realistic capture % in timeframe)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2) Top‑Down estimate (stepwise + assumptions)

Goal: start from large market estimates and narrow to marketing‑AI retainers.

Steps & assumptions:
1. Global management & IT consulting market ≈ US$300B (~£240B). Source/logic: Statista and industry reports (management consulting market often cited in the low hundreds of billions USD). Use £240B as a working figure.
2. Share for digital transformation / digital consulting ≈ 30% → £240B × 30% = £72B. (Digital is a major share of consulting spend.)
3. Share of digital transformation spend attributable to AI strategy/services ≈ 15% → £72B × 15% = £10.8B. (AI is a fast‑growing slice of digital spend; 10–20% is reasonable.)
4. Share of AI services that is ongoing strategic/retainer (vs one‑off implementation) ≈ 25% → £10.8B × 25% = £2.7B.
5. Share relevant to marketing/brand transformation (Brilliant Noise’s focus) ≈ 30% → £2.7B × 30% = £0.81B.

Top‑Down TAM ≈ £0.8B per year (rounded).

Notes: each percentage is an industry judgment. If you increase the AI share or retainer share, the result scales up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
3) Bottom‑Up estimate (stepwise + assumptions)

Goal: count potential customers and multiply by expected annual spend.

Primary assumptions (explicit):
A. Target universe (N): number of global enterprises matching ICP (global brands, revenue ≥£1B, 5k+ employees, industries such as CPG/retail/auto/FSI/tech) — best‑guess N = 12,000 companies worldwide. Rationale: Fortune Global 2000 = 2000 largest; many additional global/regional enterprises exist — we choose 12k as a plausible count of truly enterprise‑scale organisations that meet ICP criteria.
B. Average annual retainer price (P): use £200,000/year. Rationale: published price floor = £12k/month (£144k/yr). Most enterprise retainers will scale — coaching, fractional CAIO, roadmaps, pilot support — so average ≈ £200k is conservative-to-moderate.
C. Frequency: assume each target organisation would maintain one retainer (we count one retainer per company for TAM).

Bottom‑Up TAM formula:
TAM_bottomup = N × P = 12,000 × £200,000 = £2,400,000,000 => £2.4B per year.

Bottom‑Up sensitivity: small changes to N or P materially change TAM (see sensitivity section).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4) Reconciliation & recommended TAM (midpoint)
- Top‑Down: ~£0.8B
- Bottom‑Up: ~£2.4B

Reconciled / base‑case TAM = midpoint ≈ £1.6B/yr. (Use midpoint to reflect uncertainties in target counts, pricing, and market segmentation. You can present planning scenarios using either the conservative top‑down or aggressive bottom‑up.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5) SAM and SOM (base case and ranges)

Assumptions for serviceability and obtainable share:
- Serviceable % (SAM/TAM): 40% — Brilliant Noise is UK‑based boutique but has global brand credentials; geography + industry fit + positioning limit immediate addressability.
- Obtainable % (SOM/SAM in 3–5 years): base 0.5% (realistic for boutique competing with larger firms), conservative 0.2%, aggressive 2.0% (with rapid scale/partnerships).

Compute using reconciled TAM = £1.6B:

- SAM = 40% × £1.6B = £640M.
- SOM (base) = 0.5% × £640M = £3.2M/yr.
- SOM (conservative 0.2%) = 0.2% × £640M = £1.28M/yr.
- SOM (aggressive 2.0%) = 2.0% × £640M = £12.8M/yr.

Interpretation:
- To reach ~£3–4M ARR from this product in 3–5 years, Brilliant Noise would need ~16 clients at £200k/year (or a mix of larger/smaller retainers).
- Aggressive scale or partnerships could lift that to £10–15M ARR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6) Sensitivity table (±20% on key Bottom‑Up assumptions: target universe N and price P)

Bottom‑Up formula: TAM = N × P
Base assumptions: N = 12,000; P = £200,000.

3×3 TAM matrix (N × P with ±20% each)

- N low = 9,600 (−20%), N base = 12,000, N high = 14,400 (+20%)
- P low = £160,000 (−20%), P base = £200,000, P high = £240,000 (+20%)

TAM results:
- N 9,600 × P £160k = £1.536B
- N 9,600 × P £200k = £1.92B
- N 9,600 × P £240k = £2.304B
- N 12,000 × P £160k = £1.92B
- N 12,000 × P £200k = £2.4B (base bottom‑up)
- N 12,000 × P £240k = £2.88B
- N 14,400 × P £160k = £2.304B
- N 14,400 × P £200k = £2.88B
- N 14,400 × P £240k = £3.456B

If you reconcile with the Top‑Down that pulled ~£0.8B, a conservative reconciled TAM band (mixing both methods) would likely sit roughly between £1.0B and £3.0B. Using the midpoint approach earlier we used £1.6B as a practical planning figure.

Sensitivity on SAM and SOM (using reconciled TAM ±20%):
- Reconciled TAM base £1.6B → SAM (40%) £640M → SOM (0.5%) £3.2M.
- Reconciled TAM −20% = £1.28B → SAM £512M → SOM 0.5% = £2.56M.
- Reconciled TAM +20% = £1.92B → SAM £768M → SOM 0.5% = £3.84M.

(You can substitute alternative SAM % or SOM % for different strategic plans.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
7) Sources, analogues & reasoning used
- Market sizes: Statista / industry reporting on global consulting/IT markets (management consulting market in the low hundreds of billions USD) — used as a starting point for Top‑Down.
- Fortune Global 2000, global enterprise counts: used as reference point for enterprise universe; explicit N = 12,000 is a best‑guess reflecting enterprises ≥~£1B revenue globally who match the ICP (Fortune Global 2000 = 2,000 largest, but many global/regional leaders exist beyond that).
- Pricing: stated product floor = £12k/month = £144k/year; average retainer chosen £200k/year to reflect common enterprise scope scaling.
- Percentages (digital share, AI share, retainer share, marketing share) are industry judgments based on how consulting spend commonly segments; they should be refined with primary market research.

All numbers are transparent estimates. If you want, I can:
- run the same model with a different ICP (e.g., include mid‑market firms >£250M revenue),
- map N by industry & region,
- model multi‑year adoption curves for SOM growth,
- or benchmark against competitors’ market shares.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
8) Three go‑to‑market implications (actionable)

1) Focus on high‑value verticals and accounts (account‑based marketing)
   - Because the market is concentrated (relatively small number of enterprise buyers) and average deal value is high, allocate most commercial effort to top 200–500 accounts in CPG, retail, auto, consumer tech and FSI. Use senior executive outreach (fractional CAIO pitch) and case studies (adidas, Nestlé) to shorten sales cycles.
   - Implication: hire/allocate senior sellers and enterprise AE coverage; build bespoke content and ABM campaigns.

2) Tier pricing & packaging + outcomes guarantees
   - With a price floor of ~£144k and average £200k, create 2–3 retainer tiers (e.g., Strategy & Governance, Strategy + Capability Building, Enterprise AI Pod) with clearly defined outcomes and KPIs (productivity gains, reduced time‑to‑market of pilots). Consider outcome‑linked incentives to reduce buyer hesitation.
   - Implication: internalize a pricing playbook that supports upsell (e.g., proof‑of-value pilot → scale retainer).

3) Scale via partnerships and fractional delivery model
   - Boutique can’t win massive share alone — pursue partnerships with larger systems integrators for delivery scale and with specialist tech vendors (MSTR, Databricks, cloud partners) for referral/implementation pathways. Also build a repeatable fractional CAIO + coaching delivery model to increase throughput without diluting senior expertise (structured templates, playbooks, prompt libraries).
   - Implication: prioritize partner program, invest in productized delivery assets, and hire 2–3 senior fractional leads + 6–8 coaches to hit an early SOM target (£3–5M).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
9) Next steps I can do for you (options)
- Build a region/industry broken bottom‑up model (list counts by region + conversion assumptions).
- Create a 3‑year revenue/people hiring plan to reach aggressive SOMs (1%–2% of SAM).
- Build ABM target list and revenue model to show how many sales reps / win rates / average deal size deliver target SOM.

If you want me to refine any assumption (e.g., change target universe N to enterprises >£250M revenue, or change average price), tell me which assumption to vary and I’ll regenerate the numbers and an updated sensitivity table.
