# AI Consultancy Retainer • Product Capabilities

AI Consultancy Retainer — Core capabilities (sales enablement)

Purpose: A concise, outcomes‑focused summary your sales team can use to explain why Brilliant Noise’s AI Consultancy Retainer moves brands from pilots to measurable, organisation‑wide impact.

1) Primary capabilities (3–5, with business benefit)
- Strategic AI Leadership & Governance (Fractional Chief AI Officer)
  - Business benefit: provides ongoing senior decision‑making to align AI investments with commercial objectives, reduce wasted pilots, speed executive buy‑in and ensure accountable ROI.
- Capability Building & Coaching (1:1 and team workshops)
  - Business benefit: converts knowledge bottlenecks into distributed skills across marketing, product and analytics teams so internal teams operate autonomously and adoption scales without perpetual external dependency.
- Innovation Acceleration & Pilot-to-Scale Execution (Test‑Learn‑Lead™ sprints and playbooks)
  - Business benefit: turns experiments into productised, revenue‑generating use cases faster — reducing time‑to‑value and lowering the cost of failed pilots.
- Operationalisation & Performance Management (playbooks, KPIs, vendor orchestration)
  - Business benefit: embeds repeatable processes and performance metrics so AI initiatives deliver predictable productivity gains, measurable business outcomes and sustainable cost efficiencies.
- Responsible Adoption & Risk Management (policy, vendor guidance, guardrails)
  - Business benefit: minimises regulatory, reputational and operational risk while keeping pace with innovation — protecting brand trust and accelerating safe scale.

2) Delivery method — how it works in practice (what clients experience)
- Retainer model: senior AI strategist available on a predictable monthly retainer (from £12k+/month), scaled to ambition and scope.
- Cadence & access: fixed monthly allocation + weekly strategic touchpoints, fortnightly squad coaching, and on‑demand “office hours” for tactical escalation.
- Test‑Learn‑Lead delivery: short innovation sprints that produce validated pilots, then rapid productisation playbooks for scale.
- Embedded knowledge transfer: structured coaching, playbooks, prompt libraries and recorded sessions so skills migrate to internal teams.
