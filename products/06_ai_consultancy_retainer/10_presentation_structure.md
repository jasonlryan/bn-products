- To start a demo: “I’ll show a quick 90‑second demo to make this tangible.”
- To close to commercial: “If that sounds like what you need, here’s how we typically get started.”
- To invite deep dive: “Would you like to look under the hood? We can go technical next.”

7) Handling Pricing & Objections (cheat sheet)
- Price anchor: “From £12k/month” then frame value: “This buys senior strategist time, coaching, playbooks and proactive roadmapping.”
- Pilot ask: Offer a 3‑month pilot with defined success metrics to mitigate buyer risk.
- Objection: “We have existing vendors” → “We don’t replace tech; we bring senior strategy and change capability to make tech investments pay off.”
- Objection: “Too expensive” → run a quick ROI sketch (use ROI module) and highlight productivity wins.
- Objection: “We’ll wait” → point to speed of change in AI and competitive risk; offer limited pilot as low‑commitment option.

8) Suggested follow‑ups & next steps
- Immediate: send a tailored one‑page recap + 1 pager pricing options within 24 hours.
- Shortlist: propose a scoping workshop (2–4 weeks) to produce a detailed proposal.
- Pilot: recommend a 3‑month starter pack with clear KPIs and gateway criteria for scaling.

Appendix: Ready assets to attach to pitch
- One‑pager: Service overview + starting price.
- Case study PDFs (1 page each).
- ROI calculator spreadsheet (editable).
- Prompt library sample (10 prompts).
- Test‑Learn‑Lead™ playbook snippet.
- Technical reference architecture PDF.

Use this playbook as a template: swap in client‑specific examples, update metrics, and rehearse demos. If you’d like, I can: 1) produce a slide‑by‑slide speaker script for a 25‑minute run, 2) create a sample ROI spreadsheet tailored to a client sector, or 3) draft a 3‑month pilot scope you can propose. Which would you like next?
