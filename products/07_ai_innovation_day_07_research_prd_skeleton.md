**Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Innovation Day**

**1. Goal**

The primary goal of AI Innovation Day is to provide a fast-paced, immersive one-day facilitated workshop that takes a multidisciplinary team from raw idea to working concept, resulting in the creation of a live website or prototype. The product aims to demonstrate the practical application of AI in accelerating the innovation process, fostering ideation, brand development, copywriting, prototyping, and web deployment. It is designed to break through traditional silos, encouraging hands-on co-creation, and providing a tangible, ready-to-share digital output.

**2. Personas**

- **Innovation Director at a Global Tech Company**: Leads a team responsible for driving new technologies and processes. Motivated by the opportunity to leverage AI for accelerating their innovation process and improving speed-to-market.
  
- **Head of Digital Marketing at a Fast-Growth Startup**: Responsible for driving customer engagement through innovative marketing strategies. Interested in exploring practical applications of AI in their marketing efforts.
  
- **CEO at a Mid-Sized Retail Company**: A forward-thinking leader open to integrating AI to drive innovation and efficiency. Keen on demonstrating tangible benefits of AI to stakeholders and overcoming internal resistance.

**3. User Stories**

- As an Innovation Director, I want my team to experience AI-assisted ideation and rapid prototyping to speed up our innovation process.
  
- As a Head of Digital Marketing, I wish to create a ready-to-share digital output like a new campaign landing page or prototype, showing immediate results from the workshop.
  
- As a CEO, I want to present a tangible output from the AI Innovation Day to my stakeholders, demonstrating the practical benefits of AI.

**4. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The MVP for AI Innovation Day includes:

- A one-day facilitated workshop, led by strategists and AI experts
- Use of AI tools and no-code platforms for rapid ideation and prototyping
- A ready-to-share digital output, such as a landing page, microsite, or prototype
- Coaching and debriefing session on next steps for deploying the prototype

**5. Success Metrics**

- Number of workshops sold and delivered
- Participant satisfaction ratings post-workshop
- Number of tangible digital outputs created during workshops
- Client feedback on the practical application and understanding of AI post-workshop
- Repeat bookings or referrals from participating organizations

**6. Risks**

- The success of the workshop is highly dependent on the active participation of all team members and their openness to new methods of working.
- The sophistication of the prototype developed may be limited due to the time constraint of a single day.
- There might be resistance or skepticism from participants about the practical applicability and value of AI.
- The workshop requires a certain level of pre-existing idea or concept from the client side to be worked upon during the workshop.
- As AI technology evolves, there will be a need for continuous updates to the workshop content and tools used.
