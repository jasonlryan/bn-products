Card 2 — Head of Marketing / CMO (Discovery)
- Persona: Head of Marketing / CMO

- Acceptance Criteria:
  1. One candidate feature is selected with an explicit user metric it aims to improve (e.g., time-on-task, completion rate).
  2. A basic experiment plan is defined (sample size, success criteria, measurement method).
  3. Stakeholders agree to the single feature and measurement approach before the prototype day.
- Priority: Should Have
- Business Value: Focuses product investment on the highest-impact feature and reduces downstream rework.

EVALUATION

Card 4 — Chief Data Officer / CTO (Evaluation)
- Persona: CDO / CTO
- Journey stage: Evaluation

If you want, I can:
- Convert these into Jira-ready tickets with fields (story points, assignee, labels).
- Create a shorter version for a sales one-pager that highlights the customer outcomes per persona.
- Draft acceptance-test templates or user test scripts for the prototype validation criteria.
