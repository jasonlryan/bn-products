# AI Innovation Day • Pricing Roi

Below is a concise, numbers‑driven business model and pricing analysis for AI Innovation Day (price = £8,800).

1) Business Model Canvas (high level)
- Key partners: cloud providers (AWS/GCP), transformer platforms (OpenAI/Mistral), design tooling, specialist freelancers, enterprise sales channels (agency partners).
- Key activities: one‑day facilitated Test‑Learn‑Lead™ workshops, rapid prototyping, stakeholder demos, roadmap & handover.
- Key resources: senior AI strategist, AI engineer, UX designer, PM, prebuilt prompt & prototype kits, deployment templates.
- Cost structure: variable delivery labour + cloud & licence costs + travel; fixed costs = sales, marketing, leadership, office.
- Revenue streams: one‑off AI Innovation Day fees (£8,800), follow‑on implementation sprints, retainers (training, MLOps), IP licensing, workshops volume discounts.

Actionable insight: formalise partner deals for cloud credits and tool licenses to reduce variable cost per delivery and create margin leverage.

2) Unit economics (assumptions & numbers)
Assumptions (typical single delivery):
- Team time (loaded cost): Lead strategist 2 days @ £800/day = £1,600; AI engineer 2.5 days @ £900/day = £2,250; Designer 1.5 days @ £600/day = £900; PM 1 day @ £500/day = £500.
- Cloud & tool licences = £500; travel & expenses = £200.
- Allocated corporate overhead per delivery = £1,500.

Calculations:
- Total cost per delivery = £7,450.
- Revenue per delivery = £8,800.
- Gross profit per delivery = £1,350 (15.3% margin).
- Variable cost (excluding allocated overhead) = £5,750 → contribution = £3,050 per sale.

Breakeven analysis:
- Fixed annual overhead (sales/marketing/leadership/office) assumption = £240,000.
- Break‑even units = fixed / contribution = £240,000 / £3,050 ≈ 79 deliveries/year (≈6.6/month).
Actionable insight: reduce team days or overhead allocation or raise price to hit profitability targets with practical delivery volume.

3) Pricing strategy
- Model: value‑based anchor at £8,800 for standard one‑day; tiering to capture higher willingness‑to‑pay.
  - Standard: £8,800 (core prototype).
  - Plus: £14,800 (prototype + 2‑week implementation sprint).
  - Premium: £24,800 (prototype + integration support + 4 weeks delivery + governance).
- Competitive positioning: priced below big consultancies but above commoditised hackathons; emphasise B‑Corp + brand experience + live demo.
- Price testing framework: run controlled offers (A/B: Standard vs Discounted vs Plus) across 30 sales leads, track conversion, close velocity, NPS; perform value interviews to map willingness‑to‑pay; test corporate vs remote pricing.

Actionable insight: introduce Plus tier as default upsell in proposals to boost average order value and margin.

4) Scalability analysis
- Capacity constraints: availability of senior AI engineers & strategists; prep/wrap time per delivery; bespoke integrations.
- Path to scale:
  - Standardise playbooks and modular starter kits to cut delivery days.
  - Build a certified delivery cohort (train 8 mid‑senior consultants).
  - Offer remote/virtual version to scale geography without travel.
  - Partner network for localized delivery.
- Automation opportunities:
  - Reusable prompt & model templates, automated deployment pipelines, demo dataset libraries.
  - Target impact: reduce labour days by 30% → variable cost falls from £5,750 to ~£4,000 → contribution rises to £4,800 and break‑even units drop to 50/year.

Actionable insight: invest ~£50k in asset development to enable 30% delivery time reduction within 6 months.

5) ROI Framework (for buyer) — three scenarios (assumptions clear)
Assumption for client value: AI prototype either (A) avoids internal development cost, (B) accelerates campaign revenue, (C) enables efficiency savings.

- Conservative (cost avoidance): prototype prevents 4 FTEs × 3 months of low‑value dev (loaded cost £6k/month) → saving = 4×3×6k = £72,000. Payback = £8,800/72,000 ≈ 0.12 years (≈44 days).
- Base (revenue enablement): prototype unlocks a campaign with £500k incremental revenue/year at 10% margin → incremental profit = £50,000. Payback ≈ 64 days.
- Aggressive (strategic transformation): prototype becomes product feature generating £1.2m revenue at 15% margin → profit = £180,000. Payback ≈ 18 days.

Value metrics to sell: days-to-prototype, probability lift to project funding, projected NPV of unlocked initiative, time-to-first-revenue.

Actionable insight: capture buyer’s baseline (current dev costs, expected revenue) during qualification to customise ROI and justify price.

6) Revenue expansion & CLV
- Upsell opportunities: implementation sprints (£15–35k), model deployment & MLOps (£10–40k), training & capability subscriptions (£5–15k/year), governance & audits (£5–10k).
- Recurring revenue: ongoing support retainers, training subscriptions, licence of standardised toolkits.
- Customer lifetime value (example):
  - Buyer path: initial £8.8k + implementation sprint £25k + 2 years support £10k/year = total revenue £53.8k over 3 years.
  - If blended gross margin ~40% → lifetime gross profit ≈ £21.5k.
Actionable insight: target conversion of 40–50% of AI Innovation Day clients to a follow‑on sprint within 3 months to lift CLV and improve unit economics.

Summary recommendations (actionable)
- Move to 3‑tier pricing immediately, push Plus upsell in every proposal.
- Invest £40–60k in reusable prototype kits to cut variable costs ~30%.
- Track 5 ROI metrics during sales calls and run structured price tests on 30 leads to optimize conversion vs AOV.
- Aim for 50–80 deliveries/year or increase ASP via upsells to reach healthy net profitability.
