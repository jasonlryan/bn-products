# AI Innovation Day • Functional Specification

AI Innovation Day — Functional Specification

1) Overview (what it does)
- Delivers a functioning AI prototype, validated proof-of-value and a clear implementation roadmap within a single facilitated day (price: £8,800).  
- Purpose: Turn an agreed business use case into a tangible, testable prototype so leaders get immediate, demonstrable value — not another slide deck.  
- Methodology: Test‑Learn‑Lead™ — rapid hypothesis testing, live iteration, and a decision-ready output.

2) Inputs (what's needed to start)
Client responsibilities before the day:
- Clear use‑case hypothesis (1 primary use case, with target user and business outcome).  
- Key stakeholders committed to the day (CMO/CDO/Innovation Lead + 2–4 SMEs/product/marketing contacts).  
- Access to representative data or sample assets (anonymised if required) and a summary of existing systems/constraints.  
- Success criteria and KPIs to validate value (e.g., conversion uplift, time saved, NPS change).  
- Workspace (remote link or physical room), decision authority for go/no-go, and legal/compliance points flagged upfront.

3) Core Process (step-by-step how it works)
Pre-day: alignment call, scope confirmation, collection of inputs and success metrics.  
Day agenda (facilitated end-to-end):
1. Kick-off & problem framing — agree one prioritized use case and acceptance criteria.  
2. Rapid ideation & solution definition — select approach and target user journey.  
3. Prototype build sprint — cross-functional team creates a live demo showcasing core value.  
4. Quick validation loop — test prototype with sample inputs, capture metrics and user feedback.  
5. Leadership demo & decision session — present working prototype to stakeholders for buy-in.  
6. Roadmap & next steps — produce a practical implementation blueprint (risks, people, cost, timelines).  
Post-day: deliverables handed over plus recommended immediate experiments and success measurement plan.

4) Outputs & Deliverables (what clients receive)
- Working prototype (live/demoable) targeting agreed acceptance criteria.  
- Short validation report summarising tests, metrics, and user feedback.  
- Implementation roadmap (MVP scope, timelines, resource & cost estimates, regulatory/operational considerations).  
- Executive demo pack for stakeholder briefings.  
- Team capability demonstration notes and coaching guidance for internal scale-up.  
- Clear go/no‑go decision options and recommended next experiments.

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Prototype meets agreed acceptance criteria and demonstrates core value in live test.  
- Leadership sign-off to proceed (explicit decision to pilot/MVP or iterate).  
- Measurable signal against KPIs established pre-day (e.g., X% process time saved, Y% conversion uplift or confidence score).  
- Roadmap accepted as realistic and resourced-ready.  
- Positive team confidence (post-day readiness to run follow-up experiments).

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Single-use-case, single-day scope — not a production-ready, fully integrated system.  
- Outcome quality depends on timely client inputs, data access and availability of decision-makers.  
- Legal, compliance or enterprise-security approvals may delay production deployment beyond the day.  
- Third-party tool/platform limits may constrain fidelity; scaling/integration will need additional investment.  
- Not a replacement for long-term transformation consulting — designed for rapid validation and de-risking.
