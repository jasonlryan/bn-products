3) Customization guide by audience type
General rule: tailor message to pain, use language that resonates, and prioritize different slides/modules.

A — Executive (CMO, CDO, Innovation Director)
- Focus: outcomes, speed-to-value, leadership buy-in, risk mitigation, ROI.
- Tone: strategic, concise, outcome-driven.
- Deck adjustments:
  - Emphasise slides 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10.
  - Keep technical slides minimal — one slide on “tools & security” if needed.
  - Deploy ROI module if finance present.
- Demo choice: high-level prototype demo focused on business impact (e.g., marketing campaign generator or personalised content sample).
- Objection handling:
  - “Too risky/experimental?” → show governance and sandbox approach.
  - “Why pay £8,800?” → show time and cost comparison and payback scenarios.
- Call-to-action: Secure decision-maker availability and pick dates.

B — Technical (CTO, Head of Engineering, Data Science)
- Focus: architecture, data privacy, integration, scalability, maintenance.
- Tone: evidence-based, specific, pragmatic.
- Deck adjustments:
  - Add Technical Module; expand slide 8 and attach MLOps and architecture diagrams.
  - Include a sample runbook and SSO/data handling notes.
- Demo choice: live prototype with code snippets, API call demo, or an interactive sandbox (sanitised).
- Objection handling:
  - “Will this introduce security/data risk?” → show data minimisation, sandboxing, and legal/contract safeguards.
  - “How will we maintain it?” → explain handover, runbook and optional implementation packages.
- Call-to-action: Align on technical gatekeepers and required infra access for day.

C — End-user / Operational (Marketing managers, campaign teams)
- Focus: workflow improvements, UX, time savings, adoption and training.
- Tone: practical, benefit-led, empathetic to day-to-day work.
- Deck adjustments:
  - Emphasise Slide 4 (what we deliver), Slide 7 (agenda/participation), and the demo.
  - Show before/after workflows and time-savings.
- Demo choice: day-in-the-life walkthrough of the prototype doing real tasks (e.g., generating campaign copy, segmentation suggestions).
- Objection handling:
  - “This will change my workflow” → show training, quick wins and ability to iterate the prototype with them.
- Call-to-action: Confirm participating end-users for the day and sample inputs to bring.

4) Visual / demo insertion points — where and how to show
Anchor visuals to the core deck slide numbers.

- Slide 1 (Title)
  - Visual: high-impact hero image + client logos.
  - Tech: 1-slide intro animation if available.

- Slide 3 (Approach)
  - Visual: Test‑Learn‑Lead™ one-page diagram (simple 3-step visual).

- Slide 4 (Deliverables)
  - Visual: Example prototype screenshots or a 30s GIF of a prototype in action.

- Slide 6 (Case studies)
  - Visuals: 2 short videos or animated before/after, client logos, one-liner metrics.
  - Demo insertion: If live client consent, show short recorded demo (30–60s).

- Slide 7 (The day)
  - Visuals: timeline graphic 9–5, roles & responsibilities slide.
  - Demo insertion: quick interactive poll or sticky-note capture (if hybrid workshop).

- Slide 8 (Tools & team)
  - Visuals: architecture diagram, typical tech stack tiles.

Demo best practices
- Always rehearse demo twice: once full-speed, once with a backup static screenshot in case of connectivity failure.
- Keep live demos under 5–10 minutes unless audience requests longer.
- Prepare a “recorded fallback” — 60–90s recorded screen capture of prototype flows.
- Sanitize any client data; use anonymised or synthetic data.

Transition phrases — useful lines to move smoothly between slides/modules
- “That sets the problem — here’s our practical answer.”
- “In practice, this is what a day looks like.”
- “If you’re wondering about safety/scale — two minutes on that.”
- “For the engineers in the room, let’s look under the hood.”
- “To make the commercial case, here’s the ROI math.”
- “Assuming the prototype proves its value, here’s how we scale it.”

5) Logistics & quick-run checklist (pre-meeting & tech)
Pre-meeting prep
- Confirm attendees and decision-makers (name + title).
- Pre-work: 1–2 sentences on the use-case and sample data or examples.
- Shared calendar invite with preferred date options.

Tech checklist
- Laptop with HDMI/USB-C adaptor, reliable Wi‑Fi, hotspot as fallback.
- Browser logged into demo accounts; recorded demo file ready locally.
- Remote control for slides/video; microphone if large room.
- ROI calculator file (Excel/Google Sheets) accessible.

- Offer two available dates and required pre-day inputs.

Quick objection scripts (short)
- “We already have an internal team” → “Great — this compresses discovery and gives your team a validated starting point, saving months of uncertain build.”
- “Why £8.8k?” → “It buys senior facilitation, rapid experimentation with best-in-class tooling, and a demo that secures leadership buy-in — far cheaper than lost months.”
- “Security concerns” → “We run sandboxed builds, use synthetic/minimised data and contractually define scope for any PI.”

Final notes — positioning reminders
- Emphasise: Brighton boutique + global brand experience + B‑Corp values — positions us as commercial and ethical partners.
- Emphasise: Not a big management consultancy nor a pure tech vendor — we combine marketing transformation heritage with practical AI engineering.
- Close confidently: “Let’s pick a date and prove the idea in one day.”

If you’d like, I can:
- Produce a slide-by-slide speaker script for the 30–40 minute version.
- Create a 5–8 minute demo storyboard tailored to a specific use-case (marketing copy, product recommender, customer service assistant) for your next client.
