# AI Innovation Day • Demo Script

(10s) Hook — "Imagine turning one AI idea into something your execs can click, test and fall in love with — all in the same day."

(20s) Context — "Hi, I’m [Name] from Brilliant Noise — a B‑Corp digital consultancy in Brighton that’s been helping global brands like adidas and Nestlé accelerate marketing transformation since 2009. Our AI Innovation Day uses our Test‑Learn‑Lead™ approach to go from idea to working prototype in 24 hours — not slides, not promises."

(110s) Live Flow — "Here’s exactly how the day runs (spoken cues you’ll hear and use)."
1) Step 1 — Align (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "In one sentence: what problem are we solving and for whom?"
   - Outcome: A single, board‑ready use case and clear acceptance criteria.

2) Step 2 — Scope & Metrics (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "What would success look like in measurable terms?"
   - Outcome: Inputs, outputs and the success metric we’ll test by day’s end.

3) Step 3 — Experience Design (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "If this were live, what would a user do in 30 seconds?"
   - Outcome: A simple wireframe or user flow for the prototype.

4) Step 4 — Build (20s)
   - Spoken cue: "Let’s build it — prompts, integrations, UI — go."
   - Outcome: Engineers and creatives deliver a functioning prototype using best‑fit AI tools.

5) Step 5 — Test & Iterate (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "Here’s the first version — what works, what fails?"
   - Outcome: Rapid user testing and one focused iteration to improve core value.

6) Step 6 — Polish for Leadership (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "Show me the demo we’d present to the Exec Team."
   - Outcome: A board‑ready demo narrative and visuals that make the value obvious.

7) Step 7 — Handoff & Roadmap (15s)
   - Spoken cue: "What’s needed to go from prototype to scale?"
   - Outcome: A clear implementation roadmap, risks, costs, and next‑step owners.

(5s) Wow Moment — "By 5pm you’ll have a clickable, testable AI prototype — not a slide deck."

(20s) Objection Handling — two quick counters
1) Objection: "We don’t have the data or tech ready."
   - Counter: "We scope narrow, use available data, synthetic or fallback inputs and still prove the core use case — then plan the data lift as part of the roadmap."
2) Objection: "Sounds expensive / risky."
   - Counter: "At £8,800 you buy certainty — a prototype that saves 3–6 months of uncertain development and gets budget approved faster."

(15s) Call to Action — "If you’re a CMO, CDO or Innovation lead who needs tangible proof fast, book an AI Innovation Day. We run them in Brighton or remotely, do the pre‑work, and deliver a live prototype and roadmap in one day.
