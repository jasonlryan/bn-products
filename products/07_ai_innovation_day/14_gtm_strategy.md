# AI Innovation Day • Gtm Strategy

AI Innovation Day — Implementation Playbook
Purpose: Practical, time-bound plan to scale AI Innovation Day from boutique product to a scalable revenue engine (target = 10× current product revenue). Includes channel strategy, scalability roadmap, operational model, partnerships, marketing engine, sales process, and growth levers with explicit capacity constraints, milestones and action items.

ASSUMPTIONS (declare & adjustable)
- Current throughput (baseline): 4 workshops/month → 48/year.
- Current annual revenue from AI Innovation Day = 48 × £8,800 = £422,400.
- 10× revenue target = ~£4.22M ARR from the AI Innovation Day product line within 36 months.
- Typical per-workshop price today £8,800; enterprise upsell to £12–25k possible.
- Per-workshop effort (prep + delivery + wrap): ~46–60 person-hours distributed across roles.
- Time horizon: immediate (30/60/90 days), 6, 12, 24, 36 months.

1) CHANNEL STRATEGY — primary & secondary channels with rationale
Primary channels (priority + how to use)
- Enterprise Direct Sales (ABM & existing relationships)
  - Rationale: existing trust with adidas, BMW, Nestlé; buyers are CMOs/CDOs/Innovation Directors who buy via relationships.
  - Tactics: Account-based sequences, executive briefings, pilot offers, C-suite demos.
- Strategic Partnerships (implementation & technology partners)
  - Rationale: scales delivery footprint and credibility; partners handle regional delivery and procurement friction.
  - Partners: Cloud vendors (AWS/Google/Azure), systems integrators (boutique SIs), innovation hubs.
- Referrals & Client Advocacy
  - Rationale: high-trust channel for large orgs; proven ROI case studies accelerate procurement.

Secondary channels (supportive & lead gen)
- LinkedIn ABM & Sales Navigator outreach (targeted ads + SDR outreach)
- Executive roundtables / invite-only salons (positioning with CMOs/CDOs)
- Webinars & on-demand demo days (productized funnel)
- PR & analyst engagement (Forrester/Gartner briefings) for enterprise trust
- Paid LinkedIn for middle-funnel acceleration

Channel Rationale Summary
- Focus on high-touch enterprise routes to capture £8–25k deals.
- Use partners and productized digital channels to scale volume without proportionate headcount growth.
- Secondary channels feed top of funnel and nurture to ABM.

2) SCALABILITY ROADMAP — 0–36 months, steps to 10× revenue
Targets & revenue mix (recommended blended approach)
- Goal: £4.22M ARR by Month 36.
- Blended revenue approach to avoid needing 10× live workshops:
  - Live / remote AI Innovation Days (premier): target 180–200 sessions/year average price £12k → £2.16–2.4M
  - Productized Digital Offer (self-serve kits, templates, guided workshops): 800–1,200 units/year at £600–£1,200 → £480k–£1.44M
  - Follow-on implementation & retainers (deployment, roadmaps, pilots): 30–50 engagements averaging £30–60k → £900k–£3M (book in-year)
- Example 36-month target mix: 200 live × £12k = £2.4M + 900 digital × £800 = £720k + 20 retainers × average £60k = £1.2M → total ~£4.32M.

Capacity milestones (sessions/year and required staffing)
- Baseline (Month 0): 48 sessions/yr (current); core team: 1 Lead Facilitator, 1 AI Engineer, 0.5 Designer, 0.5 PM.
- Month 12 target: 96–120 sessions/yr; launch productized offering; hire/contract to add 1 Lead Facilitator, 1 Engineer, 1 Sales/BD; partner pilot.
- Month 24 target: 180–220 sessions/yr; productized sales 400–800/yr; established partner network (3–5 resellers); central Ops + QA team (PMO).
- Month 36 target: 200+ sessions/yr + productized scale (800–1,200/yr) + retention pipeline; partner-delivered sessions represent 30–40% of volume.

3) OPERATIONAL MODEL — delivery process, quality control, resource requirements
Delivery blueprint (repeatable, documented process)
- Pre-sale → Pre-work → Day-of Delivery → Post-delivery → Upsell
  - Pre-sale: scoping call, data/security checklist, stakeholder alignment.
  - Pre-work (4–7 days pre-delivery): use-case selection, data access, baseline metrics, success criteria.
  - Day-of: structured agenda (intro, build, test, iterate, showcase), predetermined tech stack & templates.
  - Post-delivery (3–7 days): handover pack (prototype code/data, roadmap, playbook), implementation proposal.
  - Follow-up: success metrics check-in at 30/90/180 days.

Per-workshop staffing & hours (standardised)
- Lead Facilitator (senior): 20–24 hours (prep, lead day, showcase).  
- AI Engineer/ML Specialist: 20–28 hours (build, integrate, handover).
- Product/UX Designer: 8–12 hours (prototype UI/UX + assets).
- Project Manager/Client Success: 6–10 hours (pre-work, logistics, post-delivery).
- QA/Technical Reviewer (optional for enterprise): 2–4 hours.
Total per session: ~56–78 hours distributed.

Quality control & repeatability
- Standardised playbooks, tech stacks, and component libraries (prompt library, reusable microservices).
- Certification for facilitators & engineers (internal 3-step sign-off: training → co-delivery → solo delivery).
- Central PMO to maintain templates, playbooks, client feedback, and NPS tracking.
- Minimum viable QA gates: Pre-delivery rehearsal (dry run), End-of-day acceptance criteria (client sign-off), 7-day technical handover checklist.

Tooling & templates to reduce per-session time
- Pre-built prompt library, domain adapters, persona templates.
- Reusable UI components and prototype templates (Figma + code snippets).
- Automated test harness for fast validation of model outputs.
- Client-facing portal to manage pre-work and deliverables.

Resource plan (hiring & bench)
- Immediate hires (0–6 months): +1 Sales/BD (enterprise), +1 Product Manager (lead productization), +1 Senior AI Engineer (capacity).
- 6–18 months: +2 Lead Facilitators, +2 AI Engineers, +1 Partner Manager, +1 QA/Operations PM.
- 18–36 months: scale to 6–10 Lead Facilitators/Engineers via hiring + certified partner network.

Capacity constraints to monitor
- Skilled facilitator / AI engineer availability (primary bottleneck).
- Pre-sales capacity and procurement cycle length (multi-week enterprise procurement).
- Data & security/legal clearance time for enterprise clients.
- Travel/logistics for in-person sessions (minimise via hybrid remote model).
