# AI Innovation Day • Market Sizing

Below I estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI Innovation Day’s primary market using both a Top‑Down and a Bottom‑Up approach, show the formulas and all key assumptions, provide TAM / SAM / SOM (baseline + sensitivity ±20% on core inputs), and finish with three practical go‑to‑market implications.

Key definitions (for clarity)
- TAM = total annual revenue if every potential buyer in the defined universe bought the service at the stated price (price = £8,800 per AI Innovation Day).  
- SAM = the portion of TAM serviceable by Brilliant Noise given geography / sector focus (English‑speaking & major brand markets).  
- SOM = the share of SAM Brilliant Noise can realistically capture in a timeframe (3 years).

Summary baseline result (single row)
- TAM (baseline) = £264M / year  
- SAM (baseline, 60% of TAM) = £158.4M / year  
- SOM (baseline, 1% of SAM in 3yrs) = £1.584M / year (≈180 AI Innovation Days / year)

SECTION A — TOP‑DOWN METHOD
Approach / formula
- TAM = Number of target organizations (N) * Average purchases per org per year (F) * Price per engagement (P)
- Use three scenario buckets to show sensitivity and realism.

Baseline assumptions (explicit)
- P = £8,800 per AI Innovation Day (given).  
- Target universe (N, baseline) = 30,000 mid/large enterprises globally (firms with roughly ≥1,000 employees or revenue profile consistent with multi‑national brands). Rationale: Fortune/Global lists + national registries yields several tens of thousands of global enterprises that both have innovation budgets and can deploy enterprise AI. This is a best‑guess, defensible mid‑point for global mid/large firms.  
- F = 1.0 engagements/year (typical enterprise runs at least one rapid POC/prototype exercise per year when exploring AI).  
- Serviceable share (for SAM) = 60% of TAM (reflecting Brilliant Noise’s good coverage of English & European brand markets; excludes lower‑priority geographies and industries).

Top‑Down calculations (scenarios)
1) Conservative (large enterprise only)
- N = 5,000 (firms with ≥5,000 employees)
- TAM = 5,000 * 1 * £8,800 = £44.0M

2) Baseline (recommended)
- N = 30,000
- TAM = 30,000 * 1 * £8,800 = £264.0M
- SAM = TAM * 60% = £158.4M

3) Aggressive (including broader mid‑market)
- N = 150,000 (firms ≥250 employees globally)
- TAM = 150,000 * 1 * £8,800 = £1,320.0M (≈£1.32B)

Comment on top‑down logic
- The top‑down approach intentionally focuses on number of enterprise‑class organisations that both match the ICP (global brands, mid→large size) and plausibly have an innovation/AI budget. It shows the market scales from tens of millions to >£1B depending on how broadly you define “enterprise.”

SECTION B — BOTTOM‑UP METHOD
Approach / formula
- Start from observable demand drivers and build up to market revenue: number of target companies by geography * adoption probability * average # engagements/year * price.
- Or alternatively: derive market from adjacent known spend pools (AI/innovation budgets) and reason the fraction that goes to rapid POCs/workshops.

Bottom‑Up baseline assumptions (explicit)
- Target companies by core markets (approximate split that sums to 30,000):
  - US = 7,500
  - EU (major markets) = 12,000
  - UK = 1,500
  - APAC / Japan / Canada / Australia = 9,000
  - (total ≈30,000 — aligns with top‑down baseline)
- Adoption / propensity to run a rapid AI POC in a year (A) = 40% will consider/explore AI in a given year; of those, 60% will run an external rapid prototype (net F ≈ 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24 → 0.24 engagements average per company per year). To keep parity with the top‑down baseline we simplify to F≈1.0 for target set (assuming selection of companies already actively investing in AI). Both approaches are shown so you can see the difference between “all enterprise” and “actively buying” subsets.
- Price P = £8,800.

Bottom‑up calculation examples
1) Conservative “actively buying” cohort:
- Active buyers = 30,000 * 24% = 7,200 companies buying per year
- TAM_bottom‑up = 7,200 * 1 * £8,800 = £63.36M

2) Broader baseline where the 30,000 are already innovation‑active:
- TAM_bottom‑up = 30,000 * 1 * £8,800 = £264M (same as top‑down baseline)

3) Capacity/market‑supply sanity check:
- If ~1,000 consultancies globally deliver similar 1‑day rapid AI POC products and each does 50 AI Innovation Days/year → 50,000 engagements/year * £8,800 = £440M (a second independent check pointing to mid‑hundreds of millions as plausible market size).

Comment on bottom‑up logic
- Bottom‑up exposes a key segmentation: if you only count organizations actively buying prototyping services this is smaller (tens of millions), whereas if you count the full universe of enterprises that could be persuaded, TAM moves to low‑hundreds of millions or higher. Both are useful: the smaller number defines a near‑term serviceable spend pool; the larger defines expansion opportunity.

SECTION C — SENSITIVITY (±20% on three key inputs)
We vary N (number of target companies), F (avg purchases per company per year), and P (price). Formula used: TAM = N * F * P.

Base values: N0 = 30,000; F0 = 1.0; P0 = £8,800 ⇒ TAM0 = £264,000,000

Apply ±20% simultaneously (worst / best cases)
- Lower bound: N = 24,000 (−20%), F = 0.8 (−20%), P = £7,040 (−20%)
  - TAM_low = 24,000 * 0.8 * £7,040 = £135,168,000 (~£135.2M)

- Baseline: £264,000,000

- Upper bound: N = 36,000 (+20%), F = 1.2 (+20%), P = £10,560 (+20%)
  - TAM_high = 36,000 * 1.2 * £10,560 = £456,192,000 (~£456.2M)

Sensitivity table (key outputs)
- TAM: £135M — £264M — £456M
- SAM (60%): £81.1M — £158.4M — £273.7M
- SOM (1% of SAM baseline; show lower/upper at same 1%): £0.811M — £1.584M — £2.737M
- SOM in engagements (baseline price £8.8k): ~92 — 180 — 311 AI Innovation Days / year

(If you prefer to use a different SOM % for an early growth target, 0.5% → ~£0.79M baseline; 2% → ~£3.17M baseline.)

Sources / logic notes
- Price P is internal (given).  
- Enterprise counts (N) are best‑estimate aggregates built from public lists (Fortune/Global 2000), business registries and typical enterprise counts used in B2B TAM exercises. Exact public counts differ by source and firmographic cutoffs; hence the sensitivity range.  
- Bottom‑up “actively buying” adoption percentages are conservative, illustrative estimates derived from typical innovation/AI adoption funnel logic (interest → pilot → paid POC/prototype).  
- Market sanity checks: market estimates for rapid AI prototyping and consulting services are typically a small fraction of total enterprise AI budgets (global AI spending is in the hundreds of billions annually); allocating low single-digit‑percent points to rapid prototyping/consultancy gives a similar mid‑hundreds‑of‑millions market figure. (Public analyst figures for global AI/ML investment and enterprise software budgets are in the public domain — use them to tune N/F assumptions as you aggregate actual account lists.)

SECTION D — TAM / SAM / SOM (single summary table, baseline)
- TAM (global addressable) = £264M / year (mid, top‑down)  
- SAM (serviceable) = £158.4M / year (60% of TAM — English/Europe/major brand markets)  
- SOM (achievable in 3 years) = £1.584M / year (1% of SAM) → about 180 AI Innovation Days / year

SECTION E — 3 GO‑TO‑MARKET IMPLICATIONS (practical actions)
1) Prioritise Account‑Based Selling into a small number of high‑value targets
   - Because the unit price is modest but the number of suitable enterprise targets is limited, go after the right 300–1,000 ICP accounts (global brands, FMCG, auto, financial services) with an ABM motion. Closing 1–3% of a small target list will rapidly hit SOM targets (e.g., 180 sessions = 60 accounts buying 3 sessions each, or 180 accounts buying 1 each).
   - Action: create a 300‑account plan (contacts, proof points, tailored vertical use cases).

2) Productise and scale delivery (to convert TAM → SAM → SOM)
   - To move beyond early traction, standardise the pre‑work, delivery templates, and the follow‑up blueprint so AI Innovation Days are repeatable and can be run by small teams or partners. This reduces delivery cost, increases throughput, and enables pricing tiers (e.g., express, standard, enterprise).
   - Action: document a “delivery playbook”, estimate consultant hours per engagement, and target a utilization model that supports 180+ engagements/year if growth demands it.

3) Partner with platforms / consultancies to accelerate reach
   - Use partnerships with cloud providers, AI platform vendors, and complementary consultancies to access a broader set of target accounts (particularly outside the UK/EU), and to embed the service as a channel offering. This expands SAM quickly without proportionally growing headcount.
   - Action: build co‑sell packages and joint case studies with 2–3 platform partners and 3–5 regional consultancies in priority markets.

Closing notes
- The TAM ranges here are intentionally conservative to realistic; the single biggest drivers are (a) how you define the target universe (N) and (b) how many engagements each account will buy per year (F). Tightening those inputs with actual CRM lists / ICP account counts will rapidly converge the TAM estimate.  
- If you’d like, I can: (a) map real company counts by country/sector against the ICP (to replace the 30k assumption with actual account counts), (b) model Brilliant Noise’s internal delivery capacity and margin per engagement to show how many consultants are needed to hit various SOM revenue targets, or (c) draft a 12‑month ABM plan to capture the first 180 engagements. Which would be most useful next?
