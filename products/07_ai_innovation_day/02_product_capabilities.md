# AI Innovation Day • Product Capabilities

Brief intro (for seller use)
- One-line pitch: “AI Innovation Day turns an agreed AI idea into a working prototype — in one day — so leaders get tangible proof, not another slide deck.”
- Value promise: Fast validation, immediate buy-in, and a clear path to scale — at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional development.

1) Primary Capabilities (3–5, with business benefit)
- Rapid Prototype & Proof-of-Value
  - What it does: Build a functioning, demonstrable prototype by the end of day.
  - Business benefit: Removes executive uncertainty and accelerates funding decisions — converts ideas to investable assets instead of theoretical proposals.
  - Sales line: “You leave with something leadership can test and sign off on.”

- Stakeholder Alignment & Leadership Buy-in
  - What it does: Facilitate cross-functional sessions that put leaders and end-users in the room to test the prototype and agree success criteria.
  - Business benefit: Short-circuits political blockage and speeds approval cycles; reduces time-to-decision and increases adoption likelihood.
  - Sales line: “We convert sceptics into sponsors by getting them hands-on with a working demo.”

- Actionable Implementation Roadmap
  - What it does: Deliver a clear, prioritized blueprint for scaling from prototype to production (costs, timelines, milestones, risks).
  - Business benefit: De-risks next steps and turns enthusiasm into an executable plan that procurement, IT and product teams can act on.
  - Sales line: “Not just a demo — a step-by-step plan to make it real.”

- Capability Transfer & Team Enablement
  - What it does: Coach client teams during the day so they understand how the prototype works and how to replicate the process.
  - Business benefit: Builds internal momentum and reduces external dependency; accelerates organisational capability with minimal ramp.
  - Sales line: “Your people leave able to run the next sprint without waiting months for outside help.”

- Cost & Time Risk Mitigation
  - What it does: Validate value before significant engineering investment, with realistic estimates of effort and ROI.
  - Business benefit: Avoids costly, months-long build cycles that fail to deliver value; saves 3–6 months of uncertainty and internal debates.
  - Sales line: “Proof first, investment later — reduce wasted spend and speed outcomes.”

2) Delivery Method (how it works in practice — sales talking points)
- Pre-Day alignment (remote, brief)
  - We clarify the use case, success criteria, and key stakeholders in a short pre-call so day-one is focused and productive.
- Full-day Test-Learn-Lead™ workshop (on-site or virtual)
  - Morning: Agree outcomes, map user journeys, and prioritise a single MVP use case.
  - Midday: Cross-functional co-creation — strategy, creative and data owners validate approach; executives invited for regular checkpoints.
  - Afternoon: Live build and iterative testing; prototype demonstrated to stakeholders by end-of-day.
- Immediate deliverables
  - Working prototype/demo, validated success metrics, prioritised backlog, and an implementation roadmap with next-step recommendations.
- Post-day follow-up
  - Delivery of artifacts, a short retrospective, and optional coaching/hand-off sessions to prepare a pilot (or transition to in-house teams).
- Commercial frame: Fixed-fee engagement (£8,800) — predictable cost vs months of internal development.

3) Integration Points (who/what this plugs into inside client organisations)
- Product & Innovation Processes
  - Feeds directly into existing product roadmaps, innovation portfolios, and sprint plans (provides validated inputs for prioritisation).
- Marketing & Campaign Tools
  - Prototype outputs can be aligned with MarTech stacks, campaign roadmaps and creative workflows to accelerate time-to-market.
- Data & Analytics Teams
  - Works with existing analytics owners to define measurable KPIs and reporting requirements (we don’t create data silos; we create measurable outcomes).
- IT/Governance & Procurement
  - Provides the business case, security checklist highlights and cost estimates procurement and IT need to greenlight a pilot.
- Sales & Customer Teams
  - Prototypes used as tangible sales or customer-facing demos to test adoption and gather user feedback.
- Training & Capability Programs
  - Delivers inputs for internal enablement — playbooks and coaching that slot into L&D and innovation training calendars.

4) Capability Roadmap (current vs 6-month vision — focus on business outcomes)
- Current (today)
  - Deliverable: One-day workshops that produce a working prototype, immediate leadership demo, and roadmap.
  - Outcome: Rapid validation, faster funding decisions, and a repeatable one-off win for innovation sponsors.
  - Seller tip: Position as a low-risk, high-impact way to prove value and unlock budgets fast.

- 6-month vision
  - Deliverable: Scaled “AI Innovation Program” offering — packaged playbooks, repeatable templates, and a tracked pilot pipeline that turns multiple one-day prototypes into staged pilots and production deployments.
  - Outcome: Predictable innovation funnel, faster enterprise-wide adoption, and reduced time-to-value across multiple use cases.
  - Added capabilities:
    - Standardised measurement and ROI framework so business leaders can compare use cases side-by-side.
    - Reusable prototype components and industry-tailored playbooks to shorten subsequent days and reduce cost per use case.
    - On-demand coaching and a “pilot to production” managed service to carry validated prototypes through to scaled deployments.
    - Reporting dashboard to track outcomes, adoption, and ROI across the innovation portfolio.
  - Seller tip: Position future offer as the way to convert single-day wins into enterprise outcomes and ongoing competitive advantage.

Quick objection-handling bullets for sales
- “We already have a roadmap.” — Great: we validate and prioritise parts of it to accelerate the highest-impact items with a working demo.
- “This sounds risky / expensive.” — Fixed-fee proof reduces cost and risk vs months of speculative development; you get a tangible, testable asset day one.
- “We’ll need IT sign-off.” — We deliver the business case, risk highlights and an actionable roadmap that IT and procurement can act on immediately.

One-sentence close for decks/emails
- “AI Innovation Day gives your leadership a working prototype and a clear plan to scale — in one day — so you unlock budgets, reduce risk, and move from idea to measurable value faster.”
