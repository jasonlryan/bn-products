# Assumptions Made
(Research gaps filled with stated assumptions)

- Pricing ranges for IDEO, Slalom, McKinsey, ThoughtWorks and Dataiku are estimated based on typical market rates and public references (assumed single-day or short sprint equivalents when not publicly listed).
- Scope and exact offerings (e.g., IDEO offering an “AI sprint” product) are inferred from publicly available services and broadened capabilities; not all firms sell a one-day, working AI prototype productised offering.
- Time-to-deliver expectations for each competitor assume typical procurement and delivery timelines for enterprise clients.
- Strengths/weaknesses are generalised across each organisation’s global practice; local teams and boutique arms may offer different capabilities.
- Market positioning statements summarise dominant narratives and brand perception in enterprise buyer communities (CMO/CDO/CTO).
- Assumption that target buyer priorities for AI Innovation Day are CMOs, CDOs, Innovation Directors and similar roles (as provided by Brilliant Noise).

# Competitive Synthesis — 3 Strategic Insights

1. Market bifurcation: design-led consultancies (IDEO, creative shops) excel at human-centred narrative and stakeholder buy-in but often lack integrated AI engineering for immediate production readiness; engineering consultancies (Slalom, ThoughtWorks) and platforms (Dataiku) provide production and scalability but are less focused on marketing storytelling and leadership-friendly demos. This leaves a mid-market sweet spot for a product that combines high-quality facilitation, marketing-minded outcomes and immediate technical deliverables.

2. Pain points persist around speed, cost and leadership buy-in: enterprise buyers consistently struggle with long procurement cycles, high-cost pilots and slide-deck fatigue at leadership level. The decision friction centres on demonstrating tangible ROI quickly — a working prototype that leaders can test is a disproportionately powerful lever to unlock larger budgets.

3. Buyers want end-to-end clarity: customers prefer concise, outcome-led experiments that produce not just prototypes but a clear scaling path (technology partners, governance, cost estimates, team capability). Many competitors either stop at strategy/design or at engineering hand-off; the most effective solution bridges prototype → blueprint → conversion to delivery partner.

# Our Wedge Strategy — How Brilliant Noise Wins

Position: “The fastest route for CMOs and Innovation teams to go from AI idea to leadership-signed, working prototype — in one day, for a fraction of the cost and friction of big consultancies or platform onboarding.”

Key elements of the wedge (tactical and strategic moves):

1. Productised, outcome-first positioning
   - Lead with a clear, fixed-price product: AI Innovation Day — working prototype + leadership demo + implementation blueprint for £8,800.
   - Package deliverables tightly (pre-validated use case, one-day build, governance & hand-off checklist, ROI hypothesis) to reduce procurement friction and buyer uncertainty.

2. Marketing & buyer alignment
   - Target CMOs, Heads of Innovation and CDOs with problem-driven messaging: “Get a working AI prototype and leadership buy-in in one day — not slides.”
   - Use case-led GTM: marketing-personalised examples (creative augmentation, campaign optimisation, customer experience prototypes) with measurable KPIs (CTR lift, conversion, cost-savings).
   - Emphasise B-Corp values and brand experience for clients who value purpose-driven partners.

3. Tactical differentiation vs competitors
   - Faster + Cheaper than IDEO/McKinsey/ThoughtWorks for short experiments — deliver a live prototype that’s demonstrably functional (not just mock).
   - More marketing-centric and facilitative than Slalom/ThoughtWorks, and more hands-on than Dataiku’s platform approach.
   - Provide a clear pipeline to scale: pre-built partner map (Dataiku, cloud providers, Slalom/ThoughtWorks for heavy engineering), and a ready-to-run roadmap with cost/time estimates to production.

4. Sales & conversion plays
   - Low-friction trial: short discovery call, fixed pre-work (1 week), one-day delivery, leadership demo within 24 hours of workshop finish. Fast contract (T&Cs tailored for single-day buy).
   - “Proof → Plan” conversion path: offer follow-on packages (4–8 week MVP, productionisation, capability-building) with preferred partner network; offer credits for follow-on work to lower buyer switching costs.
   - Showcase short-form case studies (campaign uplift, product feature proof) and recorded leadership demos as sales collateral.

5. Operational & capability levers
   - Standardised playbook and tech-stack library: repeatable templates (prompt engineering, LangChain/Vector DB patterns, pre-built connectors to common martech stacks) to ensure reproducible delivery and speed.
   - Small, multidisciplinary teams (strategy + creative + AI engineer) optimized for one-day delivery and client coaching.
   - Post-day hand-off kit: code repo, API contract, data mapping, governance checklist, skills transfer sessions to reduce delivery risk for enterprise IT.

6. Pricing & commercial incentives
   - Keep AI Innovation Day at a compelling entry point: £8,800 as a visible price anchor vs. six-figure consultancies.
   - Offer optional “executive demo” upgrade and a “production path” bundle that includes a fixed-cost follow-on phase to help buyers transition from prototype to MVP.
   - Guarantee: demonstrate a working prototype in the one-day window or a structured remediation/discount to protect buyer risk and build trust.

7. Brand & credibility plays
   - Rapid wins: publish anonymised case studies showing measurable outcomes (e.g., 20% uplift in campaign CTR in piloted prototype; 3-month ROI projection).
   - Thought leadership aimed at CMOs and innovation networks: practical guides, short webinars, executive roundtables demonstrating Test-Learn-Lead™ method.
   - Leverage existing client roster (adidas, Nestlé, BMW, etc.) and B-Corp credentials to attract values-aligned brand clients.
