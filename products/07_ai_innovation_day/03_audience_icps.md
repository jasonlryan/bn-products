# AI Innovation Day • Audience Icps

ICP 1

**Profile**  
- Role: Head of Innovation / Innovation Director  
- Company size: 5,000–50,000 employees (global FMCG / CPG)  
- Industry: Consumer Packaged Goods (food & beverage, household brands)

**Motivations**  
- Prove commercial value of AI concepts fast to unblock multi-million pound programmes.  
- Reduce time-to-market for marketing/product ideas and protect brand equity.  
- Deliver measurable ROI (revenue lift or cost-savings) within 6–12 months to justify scale.  
- Demonstrate repeatable innovation capability to the executive committee and regional leads.

**Pain Points**  
- Months-long internal development cycles and procurement that kill momentum (typical pilot drift: 3–9 months).  
- Leadership fatigue from slide decks — ideas don’t translate into demonstrable value.  
- Siloed data and stakeholders across markets, making prototyping slow and expensive.  
- Risk-averse stakeholders demand compliance/brand safety guardrails that slow proof-of-concept work.

**Success Looks Like** (measurable outcomes)  
- Functional prototype validated in one day and live-tested with stakeholders same week.  
- Clear KPI improvements in an MVP pilot within 90 days, e.g.: +8–12% conversion on targeted campaign or 15–25% improvement in campaign relevance scores.  
- Decision to fund a region-wide pilot within 90–120 days, with a committed budget ≥ £250k for scale.  
- Replicable implementation blueprint reducing future concept-to-prototype time from 3–6 months to 1 week.

**Budget Authority**  
- Can approve innovation programmes up to ~£50k–£200k directly depending on remit; spends >£100k typically require VP/C-suite sign-off.  
- Often manages a central innovation budget or can reallocate marketing/activation funds for rapid tests.

**Buying Process**  
- Typical evaluation stakeholders: Innovation, Marketing, Legal/Brand, Data Governance, Procurement.  
- Normal purchase timeline: 4–8 weeks for vetting, security checks and budget sign-off; however, will fast-track if executive sponsor exists.  
- Key decision criteria: speed to working prototype, brand-safe methodology, vendor references from global CPG peers, and a clear scaling roadmap.  
- Contract steps: confidentiality + quick terms for a single-day deliverable, followed by program-level legal review for subsequent pilots.

- Improve marketing efficiency (lower CAC, higher LTV) through AI-driven personalization and creative automation.  
- Shorten campaign production cycles and increase throughput of on-brand creative assets.  
- Show month-on-month uplift in key metrics to the CEO/Board within the next 3–6 months.

**Pain Points**  
- Creative bottlenecks: briefs to live campaign can take 4–12 weeks for multi-market rollouts.  
- Poor personalisation and creative testing causing wasted media spend (inefficient CAC).  
- Pressure to show immediate performance wins amid budget scrutiny from finance.  
- Lack of in-house AI capability and scepticism about vendor promises vs. real outputs.

**Success Looks Like** (measurable outcomes)  
- Live prototype delivering reusable creative assets by EOD: reduce creative production time by 50–70% for a campaign (e.g., from 8 weeks to 2–4 weeks).  
- A/B test within 30–60 days showing +6–12% conversion rate or -10–20% cost-per-acquisition on the tested audience.  
- Leadership sign-off for a six-month AI-enabled campaign program within 90 days, with expected ROI ≥ 3x over 6 months.  
- A documented playbook for scaling personalization across 3 major markets within 120 days.

**Budget Authority**  
- CMO can typically sign off on initiatives £10k–£100k; AI Innovation Day’s £8,800 is within discretionary spend.  
- For multiplatform implementations or retained programmes, sign-off may require CFO approval for £100k+.

**Buying Process**  
- Fast, marketing-led procurement: shortlist vendors based on case studies and speed to prototype.  
- Stakeholders: Marketing Ops, Analytics, Creative Agency (if outsourced), Procurement.  
- Timeline: 1–4 weeks from first contact to purchase for low-risk single-day engagements; 4–10 weeks if integration or data access requires security review.  
- Decision drivers: demonstrable working output, speed, low friction onboarding, ability to run test-and-learn cycles (Test-Learn-Lead™).

ICP 3

**Profile**  
- Role: Chief Digital Officer (CDO) / Head of Automation / Head of Transformation  
- Company size: 10,000+ employees (large enterprise)  
- Industry: Financial Services / Insurance / Healthcare (regulated sectors)

**Motivations**  
- Deploy AI in a controlled, compliant manner that reduces operational cost and error while maintaining regulatory auditability.  
- Create proof points to unlock multi-year transformation budgets.  
- De-risk supplier choices by getting rapid, tangible outcomes before committing to major platform purchases.

**Pain Points**  
- Heavy security, privacy and regulatory requirements add weeks/months to vendor onboarding and POC approval.  
- Legacy systems and data fragmentation make integration hard and costly.  
- Executive scrutiny over any AI pilot: needs clear audit trails, explainability and bias mitigation.  
- Long procurement cycles and complex supplier governance.

**Success Looks Like** (measurable outcomes)  
- Working prototype that demonstrates 20–40% reduction in manual processing time for a specific use case within the pilot scope (validated in 30–60 days).  
- Error rate reduction of at least 30% on automated tasks vs. manual baseline.  
- Risk and compliance sign-off for a controlled sandbox pilot within 60–90 days post-innovation day.  
- Board-level approval to scale to a 6–12 month enterprise pilot with committed budget ≥ £500k within 90–180 days.

**Budget Authority**  
- CDO can recommend and deploy transformation reserves; sign-off thresholds vary: discretionary spend £50k–£250k; major programmes require Board/CFO approval (£250k+ to £1M+).  
- Purchase depends on data access approvals and legal/regulatory clearances.

**Buying Process**  
- Multi-stage procurement: initial commercial/technical review → security & legal due diligence → sandbox data agreement → pilot contract.  
- Typical timeline: 8–16 weeks from initial contact to a data-accessible pilot; however, low-data or synthetic-data Innovation Days can be fast-tracked to 2–6 weeks.  
- Decision makers: CDO, Chief Risk Officer/Compliance, Head of IT/Security, Procurement, Legal.  
- Key selection factors: vendor security posture, data governance approach, auditability of the prototype, and demonstrable compliance experience.
