# AI Innovation Day • Qa Prep

1) Question: What’s the market opportunity for a one-day AI prototype product like AI Innovation Day?  
Answer: We’re targeting the multi‑billion‑pound enterprise marketing transformation market — our beachhead is Global 2000 CMOs/CDOs who run repeatable innovation programs and represent a serviceable market of hundreds of millions annually.  
Follow-up: I’ll share our TAM/SAM/SOM slide and the target account list we’re currently pursuing.

2) Question: What is your competitive moat versus consultancies, agencies and tech shops?  
Answer: Our moat is a mix of outcomes-first delivery (a working prototype in 24 hours), the proprietary Test‑Learn‑Lead™ playbook, a curated AI component library, and trusted brand relationships with global clients.  
Follow-up: See three client case studies that demonstrate how our approach outperformed traditional bids.

3) Question: Is AI Innovation Day a one-off revenue item or a scalable business model?  
Answer: The day is a high‑value entry product priced at £8,800 that converts into follow‑on implementation projects, capability programmes and retainers, creating a clear path from one‑off sale to recurring and larger project revenue.  
Follow-up: I’ll send our revenue mix and typical conversion funnel showing average follow‑on deal sizes.

4) Question: What are the unit economics (CAC, gross margin, LTV) for this product?  
Answer: Delivering a day is high margin (typically 50–70% gross margin) given our lean, repeatable delivery model, with CAC lowered by referrals and existing client relationships and LTV amplified by follow‑on projects 3–10x the initial fee.  
Follow-up: I can walk you through the unit economics spreadsheet and customer lifetime model.

5) Question: How do you scale a highly facilitated, bespoke one‑day service without diluting quality?  
Answer: We scale through standardised playbooks, facilitator training and certification, reusable AI modules and a partner delivery network that preserves quality while increasing capacity.  
Follow-up: Request our operations playbook and facilitator certification plan to review standards.

6) Question: Do you have the right team and depth to win enterprise clients repeatedly?  
Answer: Our leadership has 15+ years in digital transformation and a proven track record with global brands, supported by cross‑disciplinary AI, creative and delivery teams that combine consulting rigour with executional speed.  
Follow-up: I’ll send bios for the leadership and key delivery staff, plus our hiring roadmap.

7) Question: How do you actually sell this to CMOs/CDOs and shorten a typical sales cycle?  
Answer: We sell through targeted enterprise outreach, leveraging existing client relationships and case studies, thought leadership content, and pilot offers — typical sales cycles for this product are 6–12 weeks with a strong close rate when stakeholders need tangible proof.  
Follow-up: See our GTM funnel, outreach playbook and three recent closed‑won examples.

8) Question: What are the main technical and delivery risks, and how do you mitigate them?  
Answer: Risks are constrained by rigorous pre‑sprint scoping, selecting bounded use cases, using proven toolchains and contingency plans that convert failures into validated learnings and a clear roadmap to fix or scale.  
Follow-up: Review our risk mitigation checklist and sample “validated no‑go” report.

9) Question: How defensible is your IP — can competitors copy the product easily?  
Answer: While individual prototypes can be replicated, our defensibility rests on our proprietary methodology, modular AI asset library, client‑specific data playbooks and long‑standing client relationships which are hard to replicate at scale.  
Follow-up: I’ll share our IP map and examples of reusable modules that drive repeatability.

10) Question: How do you handle client data, model governance and privacy when building prototypes?  
Answer: We adopt a privacy‑first approach using enterprise model endpoints or on‑prem options, strict anonymisation, contractual DPAs and a policy of never training models on client data without explicit consent and controls.  
Follow-up: Request our data‑handling policy, sample DPA and model governance checklist.

11) Question: Why is the price £8,800 — how do you justify ROI to procurement?  
Answer: The price reflects a full day of senior expertise, a live prototype and a roadmap that typically saves clients 3–6 months of internal development and frequently unlocks million‑pound programmes, producing immediate and measurable ROI.  
Follow-up: I’ll send ROI case studies and a break‑even analysis for typical client scenarios.

12) Question: What’s the long‑term growth or exit strategy for this product line?  
Answer: We plan to grow predictable revenue via follow‑ons, capability subscriptions, partner channels and platformised tooling, making us an attractive acquisition target for larger consultancies or software buyers seeking experiential AI capability.  
Follow-up: See our 3‑year growth plan and potential exit scenarios with valuation assumptions.
