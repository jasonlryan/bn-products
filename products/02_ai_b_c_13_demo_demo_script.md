## Hook (30 seconds)

"Imagine your entire organization speaking AI fluently in just 90 days. Not just your tech team - everyone from HR to sales to operations. That's exactly what happened at [Client Company] when they implemented our AI-B-C program. Their productivity jumped 40% and employee satisfaction soared because suddenly, AI wasn't scary - it was their superpower."

"Let me show you how this works. Here's our modular learning platform designed specifically for enterprise-wide AI adoption.

And here's the magic - real-time progress tracking across your entire organization. You can see exactly who's building which AI skills and how it's impacting their work.

**[Click: ROI Metrics]**

## Wow Moment (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Before/After Case Study]**
"But here's what really gets executives excited. This is TechCorp before AI-B-C - scattered AI initiatives, frustrated employees, minimal ROI.

**[Transition Animation]**
And this is TechCorp after just one quarter with AI-B-C. Every department has AI champions, productivity is through the roof, and they've identified 47 new AI use cases that are saving them £2.3 million annually.

The best part? This transformation didn't require hiring expensive AI consultants or rebuilding their tech stack. It just required the right training approach."

## Call to Action (15 seconds)

"Ready to transform your organization into an AI-powered powerhouse? Let's start with a 90-minute executive briefing where I'll show you exactly how to implement this in your company. We can schedule that this week. Who should I speak with to get this moving?"
