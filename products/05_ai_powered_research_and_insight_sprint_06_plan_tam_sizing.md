## Generated Output

To estimate the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product, we first need to define the market we're addressing. Given the product's broad applicability across various industries and business sizes, and its global reach, we can define our market as the global market for market research services.

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global market for market research services was estimated to be $73.4 billion in 2021, and it's projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% to reach $100.2 billion by 2026.

However, not all companies within this market will be potential customers for our product. We need to adjust this figure to reflect our specific target market - organizations of any size, operating in fast-moving markets, that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture.

Here's how we can calculate this:

1. **Determine the percentage of businesses operating in fast-moving markets:** Fast-moving markets often include industries such as technology, e-commerce, digital services, and consumer goods. According to IBISWorld, these industries represent approximately 30% of the total global market.

2. **Estimate the percentage of these businesses that value innovation and have a data-driven decision-making culture:** This can be challenging to quantify, but based on various industry reports and surveys, we can conservatively estimate this at around 50%.

3. **Factor in the percentage of these businesses that can afford our product priced at £10,000:** According to data from the World Bank and various industry reports, approximately 60% of businesses in these fast-moving industries could afford such a service.

Using these percentages, we can calculate our TAM as follows:

$73.4 billion (Global Market Research Services Market) * 30% (Businesses in Fast-Moving Markets) * 50% (Businesses that Value Innovation and Data-Driven Decision Making) * 60% (Businesses that can afford our product) = $6.6 billion

Thus, based on these estimates, the Total Addressable Market for the AI-Powered Research and Insight Sprint product would be around $6.6 billion. 

Please note that these are rough estimates and actual figures may vary. Further research and analysis would be needed to refine these numbers.
