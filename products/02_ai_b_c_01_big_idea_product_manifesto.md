***AI-B-C Product Manifesto***

**Problem**

In the rapidly evolving technological landscape, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has emerged as a formidable force, transforming how businesses operate, innovate, and grow. Despite the evident potential of AI, a significant number of organizations, especially medium to large enterprises, are grappling with the challenge of embracing and integrating AI into their operations. This is largely due to a lack of in-house AI expertise and a daunting knowledge gap around AI.

**Audience**

Our primary audience is medium to large enterprises, ranging from 150 to 500+ employees. These organizations are enthusiastic about AI and understand the potential benefits it can bring to their business. However, they lack the required AI literacy across departments and are in dire need of an effective AI strategy. They value employee development and have a dedicated training budget to build their in-house expertise.

With expert-led workshops, custom learning plans, and hands-on discovery, we make AI accessible and beneficial for all.
