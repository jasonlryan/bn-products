# AI Power Hour • Market Sizing

Summary and approach
- Goal: estimate Total Addressable Market (TAM) for AI Power Hour (one‑hour paid breakthrough session priced at £300) using two methods (Top‑Down and Bottom‑Up), show formulas and assumptions, then produce TAM / SAM / SOM with a sensitivity table (±20% on key inputs) and 3 GTM implications.
- I define the primary market as senior leaders (VP+, Heads responsible for product, innovation, transformation, marketing, CX, operations) at mid‑market and larger firms in developed markets (US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia). Rationale: these are the buyers who have budget, authority and the problem described in your ICPs.

SECTION A — Definitions & formulas
- TAM (annual revenue basis) = (# target companies) × (relevant buyers per company) × (purchase frequency per buyer per year) × (price per session)
- SAM = % of TAM that is serviceable given geography / language / go‑to‑market constraints (serviceability fraction × TAM)
- SOM = share of SAM you can realistically obtain in near term (penetration % × SAM)

SECTION B — Top‑Down estimate (stepwise)
Assumptions (baseline):
- Target geography: US + EU (27) + UK + Canada + Australia (“developed markets” where English and budgets align).
- Number of companies with ≥50 employees in target geos (approximation from public business size distributions across OECD/Eurostat/US Census): baseline = 300,000 companies. (Source/logic: US/EU/UK combined have on the order of low‑hundreds of thousands of firms 50+; I use 300k as a defensible round baseline for this ICP set.)
- Relevant buyers per company (ICP matches per company): baseline = 2 (e.g., Head of Innovation/Product + Head of Ops/Marketing/CX who would buy a focused session)
- Purchase frequency (how often an individual buys an AI Power Hour): baseline = 0.6 sessions/person/year (≈ 1 session every ~20 months). Rationale: many buyers will purchase as a one‑off for a particular challenge; some repeat.
- Price = £300

Top‑Down formula and baseline calculation:
- Sessions/year = Companies × Buyers per company × Purchase frequency
  = 300,000 × 2 × 0.6 = 360,000 sessions/year
- TAM = Sessions/year × Price = 360,000 × £300 = £108,000,000 per year

SAM (serviceable):
- Serviceable fraction (English‑language, reachable with current product and GTM): baseline = 60% of TAM (reflects that some of the top‑down universe is in non‑target languages/geographies or enterprises where you can’t currently sell one‑off sessions).
- SAM = 0.60 × £108,000,000 = £64,800,000 per year

SOM (near‑term obtainable):
- Penetration (realistic share you can capture in first 2–3 years): baseline = 1.5% of SAM
- SOM = 0.015 × £64,800,000 = £972,000 per year (annual revenue run‑rate achievable within a few years with focused execution)

SECTION C — Bottom‑Up estimate (funnel / reachable audience)
This method begins with an addressable pool of individual ICP buyers (e.g., LinkedIn audience) and applies a practical funnel.

Assumptions (baseline bottom‑up):
- Reachable ICP individuals on LinkedIn / direct outreach across target geos = 2,000,000 senior leaders (estimate of all VP+/Head personas in target markets).
- Engagement rate (people you can engage with campaign / ABM) = 10% → engaged prospects = 200,000
- Paid conversion rate from engaged → buys AI Power Hour (book & pay) = 3% → buyers = 6,000 / year
- Purchase frequency per buyer/year = 1 (bottom‑up here treats conversion as unique paid sessions per year)
- Price = £300

Bottom‑Up formula & result:
- Buyers/year = Reach × Engagement × Conversion = 2,000,000 × 10% × 3% = 6,000 buyers/year
- Revenue = Buyers × Price = 6,000 × £300 = £1,800,000 per year

Interpretation:
- Top‑Down TAM = £108M suggests the theoretical maximum revenue in the defined developed market universe.
- Bottom‑Up reachable revenue (~£1.8M) gives a more operationally realistic near‑term annual revenue you could obtain with an aggressive digital/ABM program that reaches ~2M ICPs and converts at ~3% of engaged prospects.

SECTION D — Sensitivity (±20% on key assumptions) — single combined sensitivity and SOM penetration adjustment
I show a Low (−20%), Baseline, High (+20%) scenario where the three core inputs (companies, buyers per company, purchase frequency) move together by ±20%. For SOM I also vary penetration ±20% (baseline 1.5% → 1.2% low, 1.8% high). Price and serviceable fraction kept constant at baseline.

Key inputs (baseline): companies = 300k; buyers/company = 2; freq = 0.6; price = £300; serviceable fraction = 60%; penetration = 1.5%.

Calculated results:
- Low scenario (−20% on companies, buyers, freq):
  - Companies = 240,000; buyers = 1.6; freq = 0.48
  - Sessions = 240k * 1.6 * 0.48 = 184,320
  - TAM = 184,320 * £300 = £55,296,000
  - SAM = 0.60 * TAM = £33,177,600
  - SOM (penetration = 1.2%) = 0.012 * SAM = £398,131

- Baseline:
  - TAM = £108,000,000
  - SAM = £64,800,000
  - SOM (1.5% penetration) = £972,000

- High scenario (+20% on companies, buyers, freq):
  - Companies = 360,000; buyers = 2.4; freq = 0.72
  - Sessions = 622,080
  - TAM = 622,080 * £300 = £186,624,000
  - SAM = 0.60 * TAM = £111,974,400
  - SOM (penetration = 1.8%) = 0.018 * SAM = £2,015,539

Sensitivity table (summary)
- TAM: Low = £55.3M | Baseline = £108.0M | High = £186.6M
- SAM: Low = £33.2M | Baseline = £64.8M | High = £112.0M
- SOM (annual, near‑term): Low ≈ £0.40M | Baseline ≈ £0.97M | High ≈ £2.02M

Notes on sensitivity:
- The TAM is most sensitive to the assumed number of target companies and buyer density per company; changing the purchase frequency also matters.
- Bottom‑up funnel conversion assumptions (engagement and conversion) are typically the biggest drivers of near‑term revenue (SOM).

SECTION E — Reconciliation & practical framing
- Top‑Down (theoretical): ~£108M TAM in developed markets given the ICP definition — this is the maximum annual revenue if you reached all potential buyers at the baseline purchase frequency.
- Bottom‑Up (operational): ~£1.8M/year with a 2M reachable LinkedIn pool, 10% engagement and 3% conversion — this is a plausible near‑term achievable revenue number if you invest in high‑quality ABM and content to drive conversion.
- The gap between TAM and immediate bottom‑up SOM is normal: TAM shows long‑term market scale; bottom‑up shows what targeted GTM can capture now.

SECTION F — 3 implications for go‑to‑market (actionable)
1. Prioritize a narrow ICP and scale via enterprise/partnership channels
   - The TAM is moderate (tens to low hundreds of millions). To hit meaningful revenue quickly, prioritize a narrower ICP (e.g., VP Product / Head of Innovation in B2B SaaS, companies 200–800 employees) where your product has a clear 1:1 fit. Use partnerships with consultancies, innovation labs and vendor ecosystems (who already advise this audience) to accelerate trust and enterprise bookings — partnerships convert faster than cold inbound.

2. Invest aggressively in a high‑precision ABM funnel with proof points
   - Bottom‑up shows conversion is the limiter. Create case studies showing time saved (3–6 months) and a concrete ROI (first‑month impact) and run targeted LinkedIn ABM + webinar + trial promos. Focus on converting engaged prospects at ~3–5% — improving conversion by a few points multiplies revenue materially.

3. Productize enterprise offers and volume pricing to raise average deal size
   - One‑off £300 sessions are easy to buy but limited in revenue per account. Offer small bundles (team sessions, executive packages, follow‑on implementation coaching, plugin diagnostics) and enterprise packs (volume/retainer pricing) so you can move upmarket into longer engagements with higher LTV. This reduces reliance on high conversion volumes and increases SOM.

Final notes on sources & transparency
- The numeric inputs (number of companies, LinkedIn pool size, buyers per company) are based on public distributions of firms by size (OECD/Eurostat/US Census patterns), LinkedIn persona reach heuristics and typical funnel conversion benchmarks for B2B professional services. Where exact public counts weren’t used I applied reasoned, conservative estimates and noted them above. If you want, I can:
  - Recompute for a different geography (e.g., UK‑only, US‑only),
  - Recalculate with different firm size cutoffs (50+, 200+ employees),
  - Or build a multi‑year revenue forecast (with CAC, LTV, churn, conversion ramp) to translate SOM into a 3‑year plan.

Would you like me to (a) re-run the model for a single country (e.g., US only), (b) produce a 3‑year financial ramp using the baseline SOM, or (c) build an ABM funnel plan with cost estimates to hit the baseline SOM?
