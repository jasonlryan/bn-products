# AI Power Hour • Pricing Roi

Below is a concise, numbers‑driven business model and pricing analysis for AI Power Hour (priced at £300).

1) Business Model Canvas (core elements)
- Key partners: independent AI/strategy experts (contractors), LinkedIn/outbound agencies, payment/booking provider (Stripe/Calendly), content & AI tooling vendors.
- Key activities: pre‑call intake, 60‑min session, personalized roadmap creation, toolkit assembly, follow‑ups, sales/outbound.
- Key resources: senior practitioner bench, standardized templates + AI‑assistors for roadmaps, CRM/booking stack, marketing creatives.
- Cost structure: variable per session (expert fee, admin, transaction fee, CAC); fixed monthly (platform, content, marketing retainers, ops) — assumed fixed = £3,000/month.
- Revenue streams: £300 one‑off Power Hour, paid implementation packages, retainer/support, enterprise bundles, digital toolkits/workshops.

2) Unit Economics (assumptions + results)
Assumptions (conservative realistic):
- Price = £300
- Expert delivery cost = £100 per session (2 hours @ contractor rate)
- Admin + materials = £20
- Payment fees = £9 (≈ 2.9% + £0.30)
- CAC (average acquisition cost) = £80
Total variable cost per delivered session = £209
Contribution per session = £300 − £209 = £91
Gross margin per session = 30.3%

Breakeven (fixed cost cover):
- Fixed costs = £3,000/month
- Sessions to break even = 3,000 / 91 ≈ 33 sessions/month (~1.1/day)
Actionable: lower CAC to £50 and/or reduce expert time to improve contribution to £150+.

3) Pricing Strategy
- Model justification: value‑based entry price (£300) lowers friction for senior decision‑makers while signaling expert value. It’s positioned between free webinars and expensive consultancy workshops.
- Competitive positioning: undercuts boutique consultancies (£2–10k workshops) while delivering C‑suite tailored outcomes; emphasizes speed (60 min) + implementable roadmap.
- Price testing framework:
  - A/B test price points £250 / £300 / £400 across paid channels with fixed creatives (4‑week test, N≥200 impressions per cohort).
  - Test packaging: single session vs. session + 2‑hour implementation add‑on at bundling discount.
  - Monitor conversion, CAC, close rate and NPS; target LTV/CAC > 3 and conversion lift ≥10% at higher price before permanent change.

4) Scalability Analysis
- Capacity constraints: current model = ~2 hours total work per client (prep, session, 30–60 min roadmap refinement). One full‑time expert available 20 billable hours/week → ~10 sessions/week (~40/month).
- Path to scale:
  - Hire/train mid‑tier consultants (on standardized playbooks) to handle common ICPs.
  - Build a bench: 1 FTE expert per ~25–40 sessions/month.
  - Offer group executive Power Hours & on‑demand digital version to increase throughput.
- Automation opportunities:
  - AI‑assisted intake + auto‑draft roadmap (reduces post‑call work by 50%).
  - Templates for industry playbooks, self‑serve booking & billing, automated follow‑up sequences.
Actionable: automate roadmap drafting to cut expert time from 2 hrs → 1 hr (doubling capacity, doubling margin).

5) ROI Framework (for buyer) — formula & three scenarios
- Payback period = Price / Monthly benefit; ROI multiple = (Value delivered − Price) / Price.
Scenarios (typical outcomes from delivered AI opportunity):
- Conservative: small process automation saves 20 hours/month of manager time → value ≈ £1,500 over 3 months. Value = £1,500; ROI ≈ (1,500−300)/300 = 4x; Payback ≈ 6 days.
- Base: prioritized feature improves conversion or reduces churn, delivering £50,000 revenue uplift in 6 months. ROI ≈ (50,000−300)/300 ≈ 165x; Payback in days.
- Aggressive: operational AI reduces costs and accelerates pipeline → £200,000 uplift in 12 months. ROI ≈ 666x.
Value metrics to track: revenue uplift, cost saved (FTE months), time‑to‑first‑impact (days), pilot→production conversion rate.
Actionable: collect outcome data (quantify expected uplift before session) to increase perceived value and justify price hikes.

6) Revenue Expansion & LTV
- Upsell opportunities:
  - Implementation package (5–15 hrs) — e.g., £2,500
  - 3‑month retainer/support — e.g., £500/mo
  - Executive workshop (team) — £4–8k
  - Self‑serve toolkit / templates — £99–499
- Recurring potential: monthly/quarterly health checks, retainer advisory, enterprise seat licensing for scaled playbooks.
- LTV example (assumptions: 20% buy implementation; 15% buy 3‑month retainer at £500/mo):
  - Avg revenue per buyer = £300 + 0.2*2,500 + 0.15*(500*3) = £1,025
  - With CAC £80 → LTV/CAC = 12.8 (very attractive)
Actionable insights:
- Prioritize conversion from session → implementation with a limited‑time bundle (e.g., book implementation within 14 days for 10% off).
- Productize roadmap into a paid digital toolkit to monetize low‑touch leads and lower CAC.
- Track cohort LTV and push enterprise packages once an organization buys 3+ sessions.

Summary action plan (first 90 days)
- Automate intake + roadmap draft to cut delivery time 30–50%.
- Run price/packaging A/B test for £300 vs £400 and session+implementation bundles.
- Implement outbound targeting for ICP with CAC target ≤ £80 and conversion target ≥ 3%.
- Launch 1 implementation package + 3‑month retainer offer to raise expected LTV to £1,000+.

If you want, I can build a 12‑month financial projection (units, CAC sensitivity, hiring plan) using these assumptions.
