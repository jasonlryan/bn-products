# AI Power Hour • Gtm Strategy

Implementation Playbook — AI Power Hour
Overview: one‑hour breakthrough session + personalized AI roadmap + implementation toolkit. Price: £300. Ideal buyers: senior leaders (VP+/Heads) responsible for transformation, innovation, product, marketing, CX, operations.

Assumptions (state these up front)
- Baseline team: 2 delivery experts (current capacity example).  
- Delivery workload per client: 1 hr session + 1 hr prep + 1 hr follow-up/write-up = 3 billable hours per client.  
- Expert capacity: 40 working hours/week → ~13 clients/week → ~52 clients/month per expert (conservative admin friction → use 48).  
- With 2 experts → 96 sessions/month → £28,800/month → £345,600/year.  
- 10x revenue target: ~£3.456M/year → require ~20 experts (linear scale), or alternatives via productization & upsells to reduce headcount need.  
Note: adjust numbers to your real baseline; playbook prescribes hiring triggers and alternative scale paths.

1) Channel Strategy (implementation steps & rationale)
Primary channels (highest ROI for ICP)
- LinkedIn (organic + ADS + Sales Nav outreach)
  - Rationale: where senior leaders are; supports thought leadership, ABM, event promotion.
  - Actions: targeted sponsored InMail/event invites; weekly executive content; 1:1 outreach sequences.
- Webinars / Executive Roundtables
  - Rationale: high-trust environment for showing value quickly; strong lead qualification.
  - Actions: monthly 45–60m webinars focused on industry-specific AI use-cases (max 40 execs), followed by promotional Power Hour discount for attendees.
- Referrals & Strategic Partnerships (see Partnership Framework)
  - Rationale: warm introductions shorten sales cycle and increase conversion.
- Paid Search & Retargeting (long-tail + high intent)
  - Rationale: capture executives searching for “AI strategy for [industry]” / “AI use case workshop”.
  - Actions: run high-intent campaigns, retarget website & webinar participants.

Secondary channels (lower cost or longer lead time)
- Content SEO (long-term funnel)
  - Rationale: builds authority; supports nurture.
- Conferences & Speaking (targeted)
  - Rationale: credibility builder; pipeline generator.
- Email nurture + cold email (targeted lists)
  - Rationale: works alongside ABM when messaging is highly personalized.

Channel priorities (short-term)
1. LinkedIn outreach + webinars (60% effort)  
2. Partnerships & referrals (20% effort)  
3. Paid search & retargeting (10% effort)  
4. Content / SEO (10% effort)

2) Scalability Roadmap — grow from baseline to 10x revenue
Goal: 10x revenue in 18–36 months (configurable). Two parallel paths: “people scale” and “productize/leveraged scale”.

Phase 0 — Foundation (Month 0–3)
- Metrics target: establish baseline conversion metrics: website→lead, webinar→book, outreach→book. (Collect for 4–8 weeks)
- Capacity: 2 experts = 96 sessions/month capacity.
- Action items:
  - Standardize intake form, session template, roadmap template.
  - Automate booking (Calendly), CRM integration, Zapier flows.
  - Launch 4 webinars, 30 LinkedIn posts, 2 targeted ad campaigns.
Hiring trigger: wait until utilization hits 80% for 4 consecutive weeks.

Phase 1 — Scale Demand & Efficiency (Month 3–9)
- Objectives: improve conversions, reduce manual prep time by 25%, grow monthly bookings 3x.
- Tactics:
  - Hire 1 SDR/BDR focused on LinkedIn+webinar follow-up.
  - Introduce AI-assisted templates for prep & roadmap generation to cut prep time to 0.5–1 hr.
  - Start referral program + 5 partnership pilots.
- KPI targets: Bookings/month → 3x baseline (e.g., 288 sessions/month with same experts if automation reduces per-client time).
Hiring trigger: sustained bookings > capacity → hire 2 delivery hires.

Phase 2 — Productize + Channel Diversification (Month 9–18)
- Objectives: reduce linear headcount requirement; expand offerings.
- New products:
  - Group Power Hour cohort (4 execs) at £800 (per cohort) — higher margin per hour.
  - On-demand “AI Power Hour Lite” asynchronous product (£150) for low-touch leads.
  - Subscription follow-up (monthly retainer for roadmap implementation coaching) at £1k+/month.
- Channels: launch ABM program, industry-specific webinar series, partnerships with consultancies/platforms.
- KPI targets: reach 3–5x revenue baseline through combined people + productization.

Phase 3 — 10x (Month 18–36)
- Options to hit 10x:
  - People scale: hire to 20+ delivery experts (if primarily live expert-delivered).  
  - Leveraged scale: mix of live experts + group sessions + self-serve products + retainer upsells to cut required experts to 6–8.
- Concrete milestones:
  - M12: 3x baseline revenue (target £1M/year)  
  - M24: 5–7x with cohorts & subscription (£1.7–2.4M)  
  - M36: ~10x target via full suite (£3.4M)  

3) Operational Model — delivery, quality, resources
Delivery process (end-to-end)
1. Lead → Booking: landing page → intake form (challenge, stakeholders, KPIs) → scheduling.  
2. Pre-call (24–72 hrs): client completes pre-work; delivery lead reviews; AI-assisted research & industry context created.  
3. 60-minute session: structured agenda (problem framing 10m, opportunity mapping 20m, three solution proposals 20m, next steps 10m). Record session.  
4. Post-call (48 hrs): personalized 2–3 page roadmap + implementation toolkit (templates, vendor shortlist, sample promptsets, success metrics) delivered via email + portal.  
5. Follow-up: 7-day check-in, CTA to retainer or group cohort. Collect CSAT/NPS and permission to use case anonymously.

Quality control & standardization
- Standard deliverables: intake template, session slide deck, 2–3 page roadmap template, toolkit checklist. No bespoke deliverable outside templates unless upsold.  
- Peer review: every 10th deliverable audited by senior lead for quality. Error rate target <5%.  
- Client feedback: post-session CSAT within 48h; target NPS >50 in early phases. Weekly quality scorecard.  
- Training: onboarding for new delivery hires (2-week ramp with shadowing 4 sessions, paired reviews). Certification exam (deliver 3 sessions under supervision).

Resource requirements & org roles
- Delivery Experts (Consultants) – primary producers.  
- Head of Delivery / QA – templates, audits, training.  
- SDR/BDR – outreach, webinar follow-up.  
- Growth Marketer – ads, content, webinars.  
- Partnerships Manager – referral & corporate partnerships.  
- Ops (part-time) – scheduling, billing, CRM.  
- Engineering/AI Tools (contract) – build AI-assisted prep & roadmap automation.  

Capacity constraints & hiring triggers
- Constraint: 3 billable hours/client → 13 clients/week/expert → ~52/month.  
- Utilization target: 70–80% of full capacity (balance quality & burnout).  
- Hiring triggers: sustained utilization >75% for 4 consecutive weeks → hire 1 delivery expert. For SDR: when leads/month exceed SDR capacity by 25%. For Partnerships: when referral leads exceed manual processing capacity.

4) Partnership Framework
Referral program (structure)
- Reward tiers:
  - Individual referrer (consultant/executive): £50 per completed/paid Power Hour + increased for volume (e.g., £500 bonus after 10).  
  - Corporate partner (consultancy or platform): 15–25% revenue share for referrals, or reciprocal discounted credits.
- Process:
  - Simple referral form + partner portal to track referred leads. Payment on customer payment clear.
- Action items:
  - Draft partner agreement templates (legal), launch pilot with 5 partners first 90 days, review conversion data.

Strategic partnerships
- Targets: boutique consultancies, executive education providers, HR/Talent firms, AI vendors (platforms), SaaS vendors in ICP verticals.  
- Integration types:
  - Co-branded webinars and packages (Power Hour as exec add‑on).  
  - White-label shorter sessions for partner clients.  
  - Referral/commission + joint marketing funds.
- Measurement: pipeline contribution, conversion rate, average deal value uplift.

Corporate & Enterprise packaging
- Enterprise packs: bulk credits (e.g., 25 sessions for £6,000) for internal leadership teams with priority booking + dashboard. Offer volume discounts and dedicated account manager. Use to accelerate revenue and smooth utilization.

5) Marketing Engine — channel priorities, content & lead gen playbook
Channel priorities (quarterly focus)
Q1: LinkedIn thought leadership + targeted webinars + referral pilot  
Q2: ABM outreach + paid search + on-demand content gated assets  
Q3: Productized offers (cohorts, on-demand) + partners ramp  
Q4: Conference speaking + enterprise packaging push

Content strategy (formats & themes)
- Themes: “Breakthrough in 60 minutes”, industry-specific use-case playbooks, executive testimonials, before-after case studies showing time-to-value.  
- Formats:
  - Short LinkedIn posts (2–3x/week): micro-wins, 1–2 minute video snippets of insights.  
  - Long-form playbooks (gated PDF) per industry (~8–12 pages).  
  - Webinars & executive roundtables: case study + 20m coaching demo + CTA.  
  - Email sequences: 7-email nurture for webinar attendees; 3-step cold outreach to book Power Hour.
- Content cadence: publish 2 long pieces/month, 8–12 LinkedIn posts/month, 1 webinar/month.

Lead generation funnels & conversion tactics
- Funnel 1 — LinkedIn ads → landing page → intake → book:
  - Offer: “Book a £300 Executive AI Power Hour — proof of 3 immediate solutions”.
  - Conversion target: 2–5% landing page → booking for targeted ads.
- Funnel 2 — Webinar → discount Power Hour:
  - Offer attendees an exclusive redemption code (e.g., £50 off). Conversion 10–15% typical for hot audience.
- Funnel 3 — Partnerships → direct referrals:
  - Close loop with partner tracking; typical conversion 20–30% for warm referrals.
- Nurture: 30-day email + retargeting ad sequence for non-bookers; aim to re-engage at 5–10% conversion.

KPIs to track
- Bookings per channel, CPL, CAC (by channel), conversion funnel rates, avg revenue per lead, NPS, repeat purchase/upsell rate, utilization rate (delivery), churn for subscribers.

6) Sales Process — qualification, conversion, onboarding
Qualification framework (fast-touch for product)
- On intake (form): role/title (VP+), company size (>100 employees preferred), problem urgency (priority level), decision timeframe (30/60/90 days), budget awareness.
- Qualification rules:
  - Auto-eligible: VP+/C-level + expresses a current transformation/AI initiative + immediate timeline → allow instant booking.  
  - Low-fit: consult follow-up via SDR for additional qualification before booking (unless self-serve purchase).
Conversion steps
1. Landing page + intake form → instant book (self-serve many buyers).  
2. For enterprise/volume inquiries: SDR connects for brief 15-minute discovery and proposes enterprise package.  
3. Session delivered. Offer clearly articulated next-step (subscription coaching, cohort, enterprise package) at end of roadmap.  
4. Post-session follow-up email + CTA to buy retainer or schedule deeper scoping.

Onboarding (post-purchase)
- Immediate email: receipt + pre-work + calendar invite + expectations.  
- Pre-session: automated prep pack + request for 1–2 documents.  
- Post-session 48 hrs: deliver roadmap + 7-day check-in; trigger sales touch for upsell after positive CSAT.

Sales enablement
- Playbook + objection handling scripts (e.g., “Why paid vs. free advisory?” “Can we implement your recommendations?”).  
- Pricing strategy: keep £300 front-end to maximize velocity, test short-term discounts for webinars/partners. Use enterprise packaging to protect margin.

7) Growth Levers — automation, productization, team expansion
Automation opportunities
- Scheduling & intake: Calendly + automated intake + CRM mapping (immediate).  
- AI-assisted deliverables: build prompt library & automation to draft 60% of roadmap content (human edits finalize). Cuts prep+write-up time from 2 hrs → 0.5–1 hr.  
- Auto-reporting: dashboards for utilization, bookings, conversion.  
- Billing & credits: automated invoicing for enterprise packs and partner payouts.

Productization path (reduce linear hiring)
- Phase A: Template acceleration — standardized roadmaps & toolkits.  
- Phase B: Group cohorts for multiple execs simultaneously (1 lead + 4 execs).  
- Phase C: On-demand asynchronous product (recorded module + automated intake & AI roadmap generator) at lower price point.  
- Phase D: Subscription coaching (monthly cohort check-ins + office hours) for recurring revenue.  
Each stage increases revenue per hour and reduces marginal headcount.

Team expansion plan (hiring roadmap & roles)
- Months 0–3: Hire 1 SDR, appoint Growth Marketer (0.5 FTE) — cost-efficient.  
- Months 3–9: Add 2 delivery hires when utilization passed threshold; hire Partnerships Manager.  
- Months 9–18: Add 3–5 delivery hires + Head of Sales for enterprise accounts; hire Ops Manager.  
- Months 18–36: Scale to full delivery team or rely on productization; hire Customer Success and Product Manager for on-demand offerings.

Specific hiring triggers (actionable)
- Delivery hire: utilization >75% for 4 weeks OR backlog >20 booked sessions beyond 4 weeks.  
- SDR hire: lead volumes >200/month and response SLAs slipping.  
- Partnerships hire: >5 active partner relationships requiring coordination.  
- Growth marketer (full-time): when CAC is rising and funnel needs continuous optimization.

Growth milestones & action items (quarterly checklist)
Quarter 0 (0–90 days)
- Finalize intake/template/automations. (Owner: Head of Delivery — 30d)

- Sign 3 channel partners and close first enterprise bulk purchase. (Owner: Partnerships — 240d)  
- Achieve 3x revenue baseline. (KPI)

Quarter 3–4 (360–720 days)

- Formalize enterprise sales process & hire Head of Sales. (Owner: CEO — 12–18 months)  
- Reach 5–7x revenue with combination of channels and productized offerings.

Risks & mitigations
- Risk: Burnout of delivery experts → enforce utilization caps, hire early, automate.  
- Risk: Low conversion from paid ads → shift spend to LinkedIn and partnerships.  
- Risk: Quality dilution when scaling → strict templates, peer reviews, certification.  
- Risk: Price perception at £300 (“too cheap” for execs) → present as low-risk “diagnostic” with clear ROI and bundle it with enterprise packaging for larger deals.

KPIs dashboard (must-track)
- Bookings/month, revenue/month, utilization %, conversion rate (visitors→bookings), CAC by channel, CSAT/NPS, upsell/repeat purchase %, partner contribution %, average revenue per client.

Quick wins (first 30–90 days)
- Live LinkedIn ad + webinar funnel with immediate booking flow.  
- Automated intake + deliverable templates to reduce turnaround to 48hrs.  
- Pilot 3 partnerships (consultancies or executive coaches).  
- Implement CSAT + 1st monthly QA scorecard.

Closing — implementation cadence
- Weekly: Growth & Ops stand-up (leads: Growth, SDR, Head of Delivery). Review bookings, utilization, funnel.  
- Monthly: Leadership review — revenue, CAC, partner performance.  
- Quarterly: Strategy review — productization decisions, hiring plan.

If you want, I can:
- Turn this into a 12- or 24-month Gantt with hires, budget, and KPIs by month.  
- Build sample intake form, session agenda, and 2-page roadmap template you can use immediately.
