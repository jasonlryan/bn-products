- Executive pressure to show “quick wins” and justify AI spend.

**Success Looks Like**

**Buying Process**
- Typical timeline: 1–14 days from awareness to purchase for small, low‑risk engagements.  
- Evaluation criteria: speed to implementation, concrete ROI metrics, direct relevance to current roadmap.

- Short‑term metrics: improve site conversion by +0.5–2.0% within 60 days; reduce CAC by 5–15% in 90 days. Example: a 1% conversion lift on a £2m monthly GMV = +£20k/month.  
- Implementation targets: first pilot live in 14–30 days; measurable uplift within first 30–60 days.

**Budget Authority**
- Can directly spend up to £2k–£5k without additional approvals (AI Power Hour = £300).  
- Can sign off on pilots/tech up to £25k; influences channel budgets up to £100k through leadership.
