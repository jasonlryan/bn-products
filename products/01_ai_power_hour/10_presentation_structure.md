# AI Power Hour • Presentation Structure

AI Power Hour — Presentation Playbook
Purpose: Modular, repeatable sales presentation to sell the AI Power Hour (60-minute breakthrough session + personalized roadmap + implementation toolkit). Designed for senior leaders but easily customized by audience type. Includes a 10-slide core deck, optional deep dives (technical, ROI, implementation), audience-specific customizations, visual/demo insertion points, time allocations and transition phrases.
