# AI Power Hour • Product Capabilities

Below is a sales-ready summary of AI Power Hour’s core capabilities, written for use in sales conversations and collateral. Focus is on business outcomes, quick wins, and how the service plugs into buyers’ existing workflows.

1) Primary Capabilities (3–5, with business benefit)
- Rapid prioritization & clarity
  - What it does: In one focused hour, surfaces the single highest-value AI opportunity tied to the buyer’s top business objective.
  - Business benefit: Stops months of indecision and wasted pilots so leaders can allocate budget and resources to what will move the needle now.

- Three implementable solutions (immediate action)
  - What it does: Delivers three concrete, scoped solutions the client can start implementing within days.
  - Business benefit: Converts uncertainty into immediate action — accelerates time-to-value and produces early wins that build momentum and justify further investment.

- Personalized AI roadmap & implementation toolkit
  - What it does: Gives a tailored roadmap that maps next 30–90–180 day steps, success metrics, stakeholder responsibilities, and vendor/tech considerations plus checklists and templates.
  - Business benefit: Reduces trial-and-error, shortens procurement and pilot cycles, and de-risks execution so the organization captures outcomes faster.

- Leadership enablement & stakeholder alignment
  - What it does: Equips senior leaders with the language, confidence, and one-page narrative to brief executives, boards, or budget owners.
  - Business benefit: Speeds approvals and cross-functional buy-in, turning executive intent into funded programs rather than stalled ideas.

2) Delivery method (how it works in practice — sales-ready flow)
- Pre-session intake (15 minutes)
  - Quick questionnaire and optional short call to surface context, KPIs, constraints, and top frustrations — so the session is laser-focused on business impact.
- 60-minute breakthrough session (facilitated one-on-one)
  - Agenda: define the core problem → identify value levers → present 3 tailored solutions → agree next-step priorities and KPIs.
  - Outcome in the hour: one clearly prioritized opportunity and three ready-to-run solutions.
- Same-day follow-up deliverables
  - Personalized AI roadmap, implementation toolkit (templates, stakeholder RACI, quick vendor checklist), and a one-page executive brief.
- Optional fast follow-up
  - Short coaching or implementation check-ins available to convert one solution into a live pilot.
- Price point and value framing
  - At £300, this is a high-impact, low-risk investment to skip 3–6 months of research and get measurable direction in days.

3) Integration points (where this fits with existing tools & processes — business-level)
- Strategy & planning cycles
  - Feeds directly into transformation roadmaps, annual planning, and budgeting conversations with a clearly scoped priority.
- Innovation/PMO & pilot pipelines
  - Supplies pre-vetted, scoped initiatives ready for the PMO to fast-track into pilot or MVP stages.
- Vendor selection & procurement
  - Provides the business case and scope required to run an RFP or shortlist vendors with confidence — reduces vendor churn from misaligned pilots.
- Sales, CX, Marketing & Ops playbooks
  - Delivers templates and solution designs that can be translated into customer-experience improvements, marketing automation, or operational efficiencies.
- Governance & executive reporting
  - Produces one-page executive briefs and KPI targets that slot into governance meetings and investment reviews.
- Change management & training
  - The roadmap includes stakeholder engagement steps so HR/Enablement can incorporate targeted upskilling or role changes quickly.

4) Capability roadmap (current vs 6-month vision — business outcomes focus)
- Current (today)
  - Deliverable: 60-minute expert session + three concrete solutions + personalized roadmap + implementation toolkit.
  - Outcomes: Immediate clarity, 3 implementable options, faster approvals, early wins within days, saves 3–6 months of research.
  - Ideal buyer: Senior leader who needs focused direction and a rapid path to proof-of-value.
- 6-month vision (how this scales to deliver more business value)
  - Expanded formats: Group/leadership team sessions and function-specific workshops (marketing, CX, ops) to accelerate cross-functional adoption and alignment.
  - Industry templates & success playbooks: Pre-built, industry-specific solution blueprints and KPI packs so pilots launch faster and results are repeatable.
  - Pilot acceleration package: Fast-track support that converts one chosen solution into a measurable pilot (success metrics, vendor shortlist, 30–90 day proof plan).
  - Outcomes enabled: Shorter approval-to-pilot timelines, higher pilot-to-scale conversion, measurable ROI within the first 90 days, and reduced vendor selection time.
  - Scaled enablement: Follow-on coaching packages and train-the-trainer kits so organizations can build internal capability and sustain momentum.

Quick sales hooks (one-liners to use)
- “In 60 minutes we’ll give you three AI solutions you can start this week — and a roadmap that skips months of trial-and-error.”
- “For £300 you get clarity, a prioritized plan, and the tools to get your first measurable win in days, not months.”
- “We don’t sell tech — we give leaders the decision, narrative and roadmap to get pilots approved and delivering value fast.”

Use this as a short sales deck slide or script: position the session as a low-cost, high-velocity way to remove indecision, deliver immediate action, and enable measurable business outcomes that feed directly into budgeting, procurement, and pilot pipelines.
