# AI Power Hour • Discovery Qualification

Below is a compact, actionable sales discovery & qualification framework purpose-built for AI Power Hour. Use it on calls, qualification emails, or CRM fields to consistently assess fit, disqualify fast, and move ideal buyers quickly to purchase and execution.

1) Discovery questions (10) — organized by BANT + MEDDIC mapping
For each question: mapped criteria (BANT / MEDDIC), why ask, what to listen for (good answers) and a follow-up prompt.

1. “What’s the single AI or transformation problem that’s blocking progress right now?”  
   - Mapping: Need / Identify Pain (BANT: Need; MEDDIC: Identify pain)  
   - Why: Surfaces the concrete challenge we can solve in 60 minutes.  
   - Listen for: Specific, outcome-focused pain (e.g., “low feature adoption”, “customer churn from support wait times”, “slow product roadmap decisions”).  
   - Follow-up: “How long has this been a problem and what’s the current impact?”

2. “What measurable business outcome would indicate success from solving this?”  
   - Mapping: Metrics (MEDDIC)  
   - Why: Confirms the buyer cares about results we can tie to our roadmap.  
   - Listen for: Revenue lift %, time saved, NPS change, churn reduction—any quantifiable goal.  
   - Follow-up: “Do you have a baseline metric we can use?”

3. “Who needs to approve using a consultant or new initiative like this?”  
   - Mapping: Authority / Economic buyer (BANT: Authority; MEDDIC: Economic buyer)  
   - Why: Identifies decision-makers and whether participant can purchase.  
   - Listen for: Title/role and whether they are the economic buyer or an influencer.  
   - Follow-up: “Would that person join a short executive summary call if needed?”

4. “If we surface 3 implementable solutions in 60 minutes, which of those outcomes would you expect to move forward with immediately?”  
   - Mapping: Decision criteria / Need (MEDDIC; BANT: Need)  
   - Why: Tests realism and appetite for practical next steps.  
   - Listen for: Realistic implementation intent, references to teams/resources available.  
   - Follow-up: “Which internal team would run one of these pilots?”

5. “What budget or informal allocation do you have for short, targeted advisory or experimentation?”  
   - Mapping: Budget (BANT)  
   - Why: Understands whether the £300 offer is a fit and whether larger budgets exist for follow-ups.  
   - Listen for: Clear available budget (even small), willingness to expensed trials, procurement constraints.  
   - Follow-up: “Is the £300 Power Hour something you’d approve on your own, or would it need procurement?”

6. “How quickly do you need to see traction or a decision on this challenge?”  
   - Mapping: Timeline (BANT)  
   - Why: Matches product promise of rapid clarity and helps prioritize scheduling.  
   - Listen for: Urgency (this week, month, quarter). Good fit if timeline ≤ 90 days.  
   - Follow-up: “What happens if you can’t make a decision within that timeline?”

7. “Have you tried any AI pilots, vendors, or internal experiments already? What worked or didn’t?”  
   - Mapping: Identify pain / Decision criteria (MEDDIC)  
   - Why: Reveals previous learnings and obstacles we should avoid.  
   - Listen for: Pilot fatigue, vendor churn, unclear ROI—shows where we can accelerate value.  
   - Follow-up: “What prevented those pilots from scaling?”

8. “Who in your organisation will own implementation after the session?”  
   - Mapping: Champion / Decision process (MEDDIC)  
   - Why: Identifies an internal champion or reveals lack of ownership.  
   - Listen for: Named owner, team with capacity, or no one (red flag).  
   - Follow-up: “Can that person join the Power Hour or be available immediately afterwards?”

9. “Are there regulatory, security, or vendor constraints we need to know about?”  
   - Mapping: Decision criteria / Identify pain (MEDDIC)  
   - Why: Flags blockers we can’t resolve in a 60-minute session (e.g., prohibited use of external models, data residency).  
   - Listen for: Strict constraints that prevent recommended solutions.  
   - Follow-up: “Would a non-production roadmap (architectural or process-focused) be helpful instead?”

10. “How do you prefer to work with external experts — hands-on coaching, a tailored plan for your team to execute, or vendor recommendations?”  
    - Mapping: Decision criteria / Champion (MEDDIC)  
    - Why: Confirms fit with the coaching format of AI Power Hour.  
    - Listen for: Preference for 1:1 coaching and immediate implementable actions (good); general vendor shopping (less good).  
    - Follow-up: “If coaching, do you want follow-up materials for the exec team or the implementation team?”

2) Red flag indicators for disqualification (action + rationale)
If you see any of these, deprioritize or disqualify. Flag in CRM with reason.

- No concrete problem or vague “learning about AI” only. Action: Nurture with educational content; do not book a Power Hour until a specific challenge is identified. Rationale: The product is outcome-driven, not generic training.
- No decision authority and no path to the economic buyer. Action: Ask to be introduced to the economic buyer or disqualify. Rationale: Low chance of follow-through.
- Zero willingness to commit a 60-minute session or schedule in next 30 days. Action: Mark low readiness; nurture. Rationale: Time commitment is essential.
- Strong regulatory or security constraints that disallow external advisors working with data or recommending hosted models. Action: Disqualify or offer a custom, non-data session only. Rationale: Limits the actionable recommendations we can provide.
- Looking for a free or enterprise-level product demo / RFP/vendor shortlist rather than coaching and roadmap. Action: Disqualify; recommend vendor discovery services. Rationale: Misaligned need.
- No budget/funds for advisory/testing and procurement policies block small purchases. Action: Ask if sponsor will fund; otherwise disqualify. Rationale: £300 is low but procurement barriers can kill conversion.
- Wants only generic “high-level strategy” rather than specific implementable solutions. Action: Nurture with whitepaper or bigger engagement. Rationale: Power Hour is tactical and hands-on.
- Past failed initiatives with no internal owner or appetite to implement. Action: Disqualify or request proof of commitment from a named champion. Rationale: Without capacity to act, outputs are wasted.
- Expectation of productized full-build deliverables in the 60-minute session. Action: Reset expectations; if they insist, disqualify. Rationale: We deliver a roadmap and 3 actionable solutions, not a finished build.
- Competitive conflict: they represent a consulting firm evaluating your product for resale/competitive intelligence without purchase intent. Action: Disqualify and block.

3) Ideal customer scoring criteria (1–10 scale) — how to score and interpret
Scoring method: Rate each criterion 0–10, multiply by weight, sum, then normalize to a 1–10 final score. Use this on discovery calls/CRM.

Weights & scoring rubric (weights total = 100%):
- Seniority & role fit (weight 15%) — Are they senior (VP/Head/C-suite) and owner of transformation?  
  - 10 = CxO/VP directly accountable; 5 = mid-senior manager; 0 = junior
- Urgency / timeline (20%) — Need to see traction within 90 days or faster.  
  - 10 = immediate (within 30 days), 5 = 2–3 months, 0 = exploratory/no timeline
- Decision authority or access to economic buyer (15%) — Can approve £300 and next-steps budget or introduce buyer.  
  - 10 = economic buyer or direct approver; 5 = influencer with access; 0 = no access
- Budget readiness (15%) — Willing & able to pay for short advisory work now.  
  - 10 = budget allocated/PO approved for experiments; 5 = can approve ad-hoc expenses; 0 = procurement blocks
- Impact potential / strategic alignment (15%) — How much business impact the fix could drive.  
  - 10 = measurable revenue/cost/time impact; 5 = qualitative improvement; 0 = no clear impact
- Implementation readiness & champion availability (10%) — Named owner and available team capacity.  
  - 10 = owner ready to run pilot; 5 = owner uncertain; 0 = no owner/no capacity
- Coaching preference / learning style fit (5%) — Prefers one-on-one coaching and rapid, implementable plans.  
  - 10 = loves coaching/exec coaching; 0 = prefers long training/vendor demos
- Regulatory/technical constraints (5%) — Fewer constraints = higher score.  
  - 10 = no blockers; 0 = impossible constraints

Example scoring calculation:
- Sum(weights * score)/100 = final score on 0–10. (You can store raw numbers in CRM and compute automatically.)

Interpretation (final score):
- 8.5–10: Highly qualified — immediate close (book & convert)  
- 7.0–8.4: Qualified — likely close with minor objections; prioritize booking within 7 days  
- 5.0–6.9: Potential — needs nurturing or pre-work to increase readiness before booking  
- <5.0: Low fit — disqualify or nurture with self-service content

4) Next steps based on qualification score (actionable playbook)

A. Score 8.5–10 (Highly qualified — CLOSE)
- Actions (within 24–48 hours):
  1. Send payment/checkout link and calendar invite for a Power Hour within 48–72 hours. (Use direct language: “Book your AI Power Hour here — session & materials included.”)  
  2. Email prep pack (1–page pre-call brief + 15-minute pre-work form): scope, 3 current metrics, stakeholders to invite, and sample data/tools they use.  
  3. Offer optional 15-minute pre-call if they want to align stakeholders.  
  4. Mark as “high” in CRM and set follow-up task for delivery of roadmap within 48 hours of session.
- Messaging checklist: emphasize “fast clarity, 3 implementable solutions, start within days.”

B. Score 7.0–8.4 (Qualified — BOOK & REASSURE)
- Actions (within 3–7 days):
  1. Book session within 7 days; if buyer hesitates, propose 2 time slots.  
  2. Send short ROI/impact note tying 3 potential solution types to their stated metric.  
  3. Invite likely internal owner to join the session.  
  4. If procurement/approval needed, provide an approval-ready one-sheet: benefits, deliverables, and cost (£300).  
- Nudge: offer a short testimonial or case relevant to their industry to reduce friction.

C. Score 5.0–6.9 (Potential — NURTURE & PREPARE)
- Actions (2–4 weeks):
  1. Don’t immediately book a Power Hour. Send a tailored 1–pager that maps how a session would solve X, Y, Z and expected short-term outcomes.  
  2. Offer a low-effort “pre-qualification mini-call” (15 minutes) to build problem clarity. If they accept, retest scoring.  
  3. Send relevant case study + checklist of information the exec should gather to make the Power Hour productive (metrics, system access, stakeholder list).  
  4. Set a CRM reminder to re-engage in 2–4 weeks or after a trigger (budget cycle, product release).
- Goal: Move them to 7+ by clarifying impact and ownership.

D. Score <5.0 (Low fit — DISQUALIFY OR ALTERNATE)
- Actions:
  1. If disqualify: mark reason in CRM, politely close conversation and offer alternatives (e.g., self-serve resources, newsletter, on-demand webinar).  
  2. If regulatory/technical blocker: offer a tailored “safe” session (no external data discussion) only if they agree to limited scope — otherwise disqualify.  
  3. Set a long-term nurture cadence (quarterly) and provide content that targets their gap (e.g., how to build an internal champion).
- Messaging: brief, helpful, and clear next steps or resources.

Ancillary: Ready-to-use call close / booking script
- If high fit: “Great — this is exactly what the AI Power Hour is designed for. I’ll send a booking link and a 1-page prep form so we hit the floor running. Which of these two slots works best: [Slot A] or [Slot B]?”
- If procurement barrier: “I can send a one-page justification your procurement team can use. If approved, we can schedule in the same week.”

Operational tips for reps
- Pre-call prep form must include: current metric baseline, existing systems, named internal owner, and any data/security constraints. This reduces wasted sessions.  
- Use CRM fields to record: final score, red-flag reason, economic buyer name, confirmed timeline, and booked session date.  
- Post-session follow-up: deliver the personalized roadmap and implementation toolkit within 48 hours; include 3 prioritized solutions with next-step owners and a 30/60/90 day checklist.

Use this framework to standardize qualification, accelerate conversion for high-value leaders, and quickly triage low-fit prospects — keeping AI Power Hour focused on executives who want fast, actionable results and are ready to act.
