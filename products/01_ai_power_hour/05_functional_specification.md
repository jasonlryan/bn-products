# AI Power Hour • Functional Specification

1) Overview
AI Power Hour is a paid, business-focused 60-minute breakthrough consultation that turns a senior leader’s single AI challenge into three immediately actionable solutions plus a personalized roadmap and implementation toolkit. It’s designed to cut 3–6 months of trial-and-error out of AI decision-making by delivering prioritized, business-aligned options you can act on within days.

Price: £300

2) Inputs (what’s needed to start)
- Client: senior leader responsible for transformation/innovation/marketing/CX/operations
- Defined challenge statement (one page or 10–15 bullet intake form) that specifies objective, success metrics, current constraints, and stakeholders
- Recent relevant artifacts (organizational goals, process maps, KPIs, data availability summary, vendor list) — optional but recommended
- Single session sponsor and decision-maker who will attend the session
- Scheduling and confirmation of 60-minute slot

3) Core Process (step-by-step business logic)
1. Intake (pre-session, 48–72 hrs): Client submits challenge statement + optional artifacts; selects decision-maker attendee.
2. Rapid analysis (2–4 business hours): Facilitator synthesizes inputs, frames hypotheses, identifies one highest-value opportunity, and prepares targeted diagnostic questions.
3. 60-minute breakthrough session (structured):
   - 10 min: Problem alignment — confirm objective, constraints, and success metrics.
   - 15 min: Current-state diagnosis — surface root causes, data readiness, stakeholder dynamics.
   - 25 min: Solution ideation & prioritization — present and co-refine 3 specific solutions (scope, expected impact, quick wins).
   - 10 min: Next-step roadmapping — agree priorities, owners, and immediate actions.
4. Deliverable creation (within 48 hrs): Produce personalized AI roadmap + implementation toolkit aligned to session outcomes.
5. Handover & acceptance: Send deliverables, invite brief walk-through (optional follow-up call), capture client feedback and immediate decisions.

4) Outputs & Deliverables
- 60-minute facilitated breakthrough session
- Three prioritized, scoped solutions with estimated impact and time-to-value
- Personalized AI roadmap (30/90/180-day milestones, owners, success metrics)
- Implementation toolkit (playbook for first 2–4 sprints, data readiness checklist, stakeholder map, resource/time estimates, risk & mitigation notes)
- Executive one-page summary for stakeholder communication
- Optional short follow-up to review adoption plan

5) Success Criteria (how we measure success)
- Short-term:
  - Client confirms clear next steps within 48 hours (binary)
  - Client rates confidence to lead initiative ≥ 8/10 in post-session survey
  - Delivery of roadmap and toolkit within 48 hours
- Medium-term (30–90 days):
  - At least one recommended solution initiated within 30 days
  - Measurable early metric improvement (e.g., time saved, conversion uplift) documented or tracked
  - Repeat engagement or referral rate ≥ target percentage
- Business value:
  - Time-to-decision reduced vs. baseline (target: 3–6 months saved)
  - Stakeholder sign-off for budget or pilot within 90 days

6) Constraints & Limitations
- Scope-limited: single challenge, single 60-minute session; not a full implementation service
- Not a substitute for technical integration, custom engineering, or procurement — may recommend those next steps
- Outcomes depend on quality of client inputs and stakeholder availability
- No guaranteed ROI; value contingent on client execution and organizational readiness
- Regulatory, legal, or vendor-specific due diligence is out of scope and must be handled by client or follow-up engagements
