# AI Power Hour â€¢ Executive Positioning

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem
Senior leaders with responsibility for transformation are stuck deciding which AI initiatives will move the business forward and which are wasted pilots. That indecision costs months of research, misdirected vendor trials, and stalled budgets.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
- A focused 60-minute breakthrough session that surfaces the single highest-value AI opportunity for your exact challenge.  
- Deliver three specific, scoped solutions you can start implementing within days (including success metrics and estimated effort).  
- A personalized AI roadmap that replaces 3â€“6 months of trial-and-error with clear next steps, owners, and timelines.  
- An implementation toolkit and follow-up materials that translate recommendations into immediate actions your team can execute.

## âœ¨ Magic Moment
Forty-five minutes in, you can point to one scoped pilot with an owner, a 30â€“90 day success metric, and the first tasks to start â€” and you feel capable of leading it.

## Audience
- Senior leaders responsible for transformation, innovation, marketing, customer experience, or operations.  
- Executives overwhelmed by AI possibilities who need focused, practical direction now.  
- Leaders who prefer hands-on, personalized coaching to translate strategy into action.

## Why We're Excited
We've seen clients spend months and tens of thousands on exploratory pilots that never delivered because they lacked a clear first pilot, owner, and metric. At Â£300, AI Power Hour compresses that discovery work into an expert-led hour and a tangible roadmap, so leaders can test, measure, and learn in days instead of months. As founders, we believe accelerating one high-confidence pilot per team reduces wasted spend, creates visible wins for AI sponsors, and changes how organizations fund the next wave of transformation.

## Positioning Statement
AI Power Hour â€” the Â£300, expert-led 60â€‘minute session that gives senior leaders three implementable AI solutions and a personalized roadmap to skip months of trial-and-error.
