  Position as an independent, business-first advisor that gives senior leaders immediate, vendor-agnostic options they can take to their cloud teams — especially useful for leaders who are deciding strategy before committing to a vendor.

Assumptions Made
- Pricing estimates are ranges based on public program fees, industry norms and informal market intel; specific RFPs can differ significantly. (e.g., McKinsey workshop £50k–£250k; DataRobot sprint £10k–£100k).
- Representative companies are aggregated by category where many vendors compete with similar offerings (e.g., McKinsey/BCG/Accenture grouped as “global consultancies”).
- Quality variance in marketplaces (Clarity/GLG) and independence of experts is assumed significant based on marketplace models and reviews.
- Time-to-value: global consultancies and executive education are assumed to deliver impact slower (weeks–months) compared to an expert call.
- AI Power Hour buyer persona: senior leaders seeking immediate clarity and actionable next steps; price sensitivity around £300 is assumed for early-market adopters and for impulse/low-friction purchase.
- Implementation expectation: AI Power Hour’s deliverables (3 solutions + roadmap + toolkit) are assumed to be sufficient to start immediate work with internal teams or vendors.
- Market sizes and procurement behavior (enterprise procurement friction vs. individual executive purchase) are generalized.

Competitive Synthesis — 3 Strategic Insights
1. Speed + Specificity is under-served at senior-exec price points.  
   - Enterprise consultancies and academic programs sell credibility and deep rigor but are slow and expensive. Marketplaces and vendor programs provide speed but lack standardized, outcome-oriented deliverables for exec decision-making. A compact, priced, outcome-guaranteed session occupies a clear tactical niche.
2. Decision-stage buyers want business-first, vendor-agnostic clarity before technical commitments.  
   - Platform vendors and ML-platform consultancies push technical pilots; many leaders instead need a business-case, prioritization and scoped, low-risk next steps. Delivering business-scoped options (with technical feasibility notes) creates immediate value.
3. Trust + deliverables beat remit-only conversations.  
   - One-off expert calls often leave clients with insight but no implementation plan; execs are willing to pay for a short session if it ends with a concrete implementation roadmap and toolkit that reduces downstream friction and accelerates approvals.

Our Wedge Strategy — How AI Power Hour Wins
1. Positioning: “60-minute, C-suite-ready breakthrough with guaranteed, implementable outcomes”  
   - Use messaging that contrasts speed, price and deliverables versus consultancies (“Same clarity in 1 hour for £300 vs months and tens of thousands”), and versus marketplaces (“Structured, vetted, deliverable-first session — not an ad hoc call”).
2. Productized deliverable as primary differentiator  
   - Standardize the output: 3 prioritized solutions (scope + expected impact + success metrics), 90-day personalized roadmap, and a lightweight implementation toolkit (stakeholder map, sample RACI, vendor shortlists, one-page business case template). Guarantee delivery in 48 hours post-session.
3. Pricing & GTM: low-friction, aspirational price + direct outreach to exec channels  
   - Keep price at £300 as an entry product for immediate conversion. Offer enterprise bundles (e.g., 5 sessions for leadership teams at a discount) for L&D/innovation budgets. Use inbound channels: LinkedIn ads targeting job titles, partnerships with exec education buyers, and Slack/CEO communities. Provide a clear money-back or follow-up micro-support incentive if the session doesn’t produce 3 viable options.
4. Product features to exploit gaps: vendor-agnostic, business-first, proof-of-implementation  
   - Train facilitators to produce not only ideas but scoppable quick wins (5–10 day pilots or A/B tests) that internal teams or cloud partners can execute. Provide optional add-ons: a 2-hour technical handover with a cloud/ML partner, or a 1-week rapid proof-of-value engagement to convert the session into a small paid pilot.
5. Trust-building and repeatability  
   - Publish short case studies showing “hours-to-outcome” wins and measurable early metrics. Vet and certify facilitators with a standard framework so clients get consistent quality across calls — addressing a key weakness of marketplaces.

Recommended Tactical Next Steps (practical)
- Refine landing page copy to emphasize deliverables and time-to-impact (3 solutions + 48-hr roadmap delivery).  
- Build a short “pilot conversion path”: an optional fixed-scope 1-week pilot priced and positioned as the natural next step.  
- Create two GTM channels: (a) direct outreach to VPs/Heads (innovation, product, ops, marketing) with case-study-led messaging; (b) partnerships with exec education buyers and vendor partners who need business-first scoping.  
- Offer a “team” product (e.g., 3 sessions for leadership team at £750) to move procurement from individual purchase to budgeted buy.

Summary
AI Power Hour sits in an attractive gap: trusted, outcome-focused, rapid advisory for senior leaders priced for immediate purchase. The competitive set either aims too high (consultancies, exec ed), too technical/vendor-specific (platform vendors), or too unstructured (expert marketplaces). By doubling down on a standardized, vendor-agnostic deliverable, quick turnaround, and a clear next-step conversion path (rapid pilot), AI Power Hour can capture leaders who need to decide fast and show near-term impact without the cost or delay of enterprise engagements.

If you’d like, I can:
- Draft proposed landing page copy and pricing bundles.  
- Produce a 90‑day playbook for converting sessions into paid pilots.  
- Create objection-handling scripts for sales outreach to procurement and executives.
