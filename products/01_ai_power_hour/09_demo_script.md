# AI Power Hour • Demo Script

Hook (10s)
(10s) "Quick question — what if one hour could stop you wasting three months on the wrong AI pilot? In 60 minutes we find the high-value AI move your team actually needs."

Context (20s)
(20s) "I’m running AI Power Hour — a 60-minute breakthrough session for senior leaders. For £300 you get the live session, three specific, implementable solutions, a personalized AI roadmap, and an implementation toolkit to skip months of trial-and-error."

Live Flow — 8 steps with spoken cues (100s total; ~12–13s per step)
(100s)
1) Framing the challenge (12s)
   Spoken cue: "Start by telling me the one AI problem keeping you up at night — what outcome do you absolutely need?"
   What we do: Rapidly anchor on the real business objective.

2) Define success (12s)
   Spoken cue: "On a scale of 1 to 10, how much impact would solving this have on revenue, cost, or customer experience?"
   What we do: Quantify impact so we focus on measurable wins.

3) Constraints & context (12s)
   Spoken cue: "What limits you today — data, people, budget, vendor politics?"
   What we do: Surface practical constraints that shape feasible solutions.

4) Prioritise opportunities (13s)
   Spoken cue: "If we had to pick one high-return path right now, which of these would you want to explore?"
   What we do: Apply a quick prioritisation framework to pick the single highest-value opportunity.

5) Rapid ideation — three solutions (13s)
   Spoken cue: "I’m going to outline three concrete ways to win here — a quick win, a scaling play, and a low-risk test."
   What we do: Deliver three scoped, actionable solutions you can start immediately.

6) Quick proof sketch (13s)
   Spoken cue: "Here’s a one-paragraph proof-of-concept for the top idea — who does what in week one?"
   What we do: Map immediate next steps and responsibilities for a fast POC.

7) Roadmap & risks (12s)
   Spoken cue: "Now let’s align the roadmap — 30, 90, 180-day milestones and the top risks to watch."
   What we do: Produce a prioritized roadmap that skips months of trial-and-error.

8) Commitments & deliverables (13s)
   Spoken cue: "Final check — which of these three moves are you committing to test in the next 14 days?"
   What we do: Lock in decisions and confirm the personalized follow-up toolkit and roadmap you’ll receive.

Wow Moment (10s)
(10s) "In one hour you walk out with three ready-to-run AI moves and a roadmap that shrinks months of guessing into days of action."

Objection Handling — 2 quick counters (20s)
(20s)
- Objection: "We already have vendors/in-house teams." Counter: "Great — we tailor solutions to work with your stack and vendors, so this session accelerates what you already have instead of duplicating it."
- Objection: "We’re too busy to add another meeting." Counter: "That’s exactly why this works — 60 focused minutes replaces months of trial-and-error and gives your team a clear 14-day pilot plan."
