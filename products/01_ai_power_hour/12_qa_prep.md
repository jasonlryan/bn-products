# AI Power Hour • Qa Prep

1) Q: What is the real market opportunity for AI Power Hour?  
A: We target senior leaders (transformation, product, marketing, ops) at mid‑market and enterprise organisations who are actively budgeting for AI initiatives — a large, growing buyer segment that values fast, low‑risk decisions and is underpenetrated by focused, high‑signal advisory products.  
Follow-up: I can send a one‑page TAM/SAM/SOM breakdown for our ICPs and buying motion.

2) Q: How do you acquire customers and what are your CAC drivers?  
A: Acquisition combines targeted outbound to named executives, thought‑leadership content/speaking, channel partnerships with consultancies, and paid pilots; the £300 price point and short format create a low barrier-to-entry that reduces initial friction and shortens sales cycles.  
Follow-up: Want our CAC by channel and conversion funnels for the last 12 months?

3) Q: What is your revenue model and how do you scale beyond one‑off sessions?  
A: Core revenue is the £300 Power Hour, with scalable upsells into multi‑session advisory, implementation toolkits, enterprise packages, and partner revenue shares — a land‑and‑expand motion that converts short engagements into higher‑value recurring work.  
Follow-up: I can share examples of typical upsell paths and conversion rates.

4) Q: Are the unit economics attractive and payback reasonable?  
A: Unit economics are strong because marginal cost is primarily expert time plus templated deliverables, while high‑value upsells materially increase LTV so CAC payback is quick when a client converts to advisory or implementation.  
Follow-up: I’ll send the unit economics model (CAC, LTV, payback) used in our investor deck.

5) Q: What defensible moat do you have versus consultancies and training companies?  
A: Our moat is a repeatable, industry‑tuned diagnostic framework and proprietary implementation playbooks plus an expert network and accumulating outcome data that shortens time‑to‑value and creates repeatable deliverables unlike ad‑hoc consultancy work.  
Follow-up: Interested in a sample playbook and anonymised outcome data?

6) Q: Who are your main competitors and why will you win?  
A: Competitors include boutique strategy consultancies, generic training vendors, and freelance coaches, but we win on speed, price, and prescriptive outcomes — delivering three implementable solutions and a roadmap in one session at a fraction of traditional consulting cost.  
Follow-up: I can send a concise competitive matrix showing positioning and price comparisons.

7) Q: Tell me about the team and do they have the credibility to close and deliver?  
A: The team blends senior AI practitioners, former transformation leads, and experienced executive coaches who have delivered enterprise AI programs and can credibly engage C‑level buyers and their implementation teams.  
Follow-up: I’ll email short bios and two client references you can call.

8) Q: How do you ensure clients actually implement the recommendations?  
A: We design deliverables for immediate action (three scoped solutions, implementation toolkit, and follow‑up steps) and offer short implementation sprints or vendor introductions to remove execution blockers and increase follow‑through.  
Follow-up: Want our implementation success rate and typical timelines?

9) Q: What are the biggest business risks and your mitigation plans?  
A: Top risks are low conversion to paid advisory, talent scaling, and macro budget freezes; we mitigate with a low‑price entry product that de‑risks procurement, a certification/QA program for consultants, and diversified channel revenue.  
Follow-up: I can share our risk‑register and mitigation roadmap.

10) Q: How do you handle data security, privacy, and enterprise compliance?  
A: We default to client‑owned, redacted materials, operate under NDAs, support enterprise security requirements (SaaS/VPN/on‑prem options), and never retain sensitive PII unless explicitly agreed under strict controls.  
Follow-up: I’ll attach our security & privacy checklist and sample NDA for review.

11) Q: Are you dependent on third‑party LLMs and what if those vendors change terms or quality?  
A: Our recommendations are vendor‑agnostic playbooks grounded in engineering patterns and business processes, and we support on‑prem or restricted LLM deployments so vendor changes don’t break client deliverables.  
Follow-up: We can walk through a technical appendix that maps solutions to vendor‑agnostic architectures.

12) Q: How will you scale expert capacity without diluting quality?  
A: We scale via a certified practitioner program, standardised facilitation templates, automated deliverable generators, and a two‑stage QA process that preserves quality while enabling partner and freelance scaling.  
Follow-up: Would you like to review the certification curriculum and QA metrics?
