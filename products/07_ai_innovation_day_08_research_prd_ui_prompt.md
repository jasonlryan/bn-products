## Generated Output

**UI Prompt for Design Tool: AI Innovation Day**

The AI Innovation Day workshop is a one-day event that requires a design tool interface that is intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly for participants with varying levels of familiarity with AI and design tools. The UI should reflect the product's core values of speed, efficiency, collaboration, and innovation.

**1. Welcome Screen:**

The Welcome Screen sets the tone for the workshop. It should include the AI Innovation Day logo, a brief description of the workshop, and a welcoming message. The design should convey a sense of excitement and anticipation. Maintain a clean, minimal design with our brand colors for a professional look.

**2. Agenda Screen:**

This screen should provide an overview of the day's schedule, broken down into phases such as Ideation, Prototyping, and Debriefing. Create a dynamic, scrollable timeline with interactive elements for each phase. Include short descriptions and estimated timeframes for each activity.

**3. Collaboration Screen:**

This is where the magic happens. The Collaboration Screen is where teams work together on their ideas. It should provide a shared workspace with drag-and-drop capability for elements such as text boxes, images, and shapes. Include AI-powered features like suggestion prompts and automated design options to facilitate rapid prototyping.

**4. AI Assistant Screen:**

The AI Assistant is a key feature of the workshop, providing real-time suggestions and enhancements. It should be easily accessible from all screens via a floating button or a slide-out panel. The AI Assistant should have a friendly, conversational interface, reinforcing the 'show, not tell' ethos of the workshop.

**5. Debriefing Screen:**

At the end of the workshop, teams will reflect on their experience and discuss next steps. The Debriefing Screen should provide a space for teams to summarize their work, list key learnings, and plan next steps. It should also include an option to download or share the day's output (e.g., landing page, prototype).

**6. Feedback Screen:**

After the workshop, participants are prompted to give feedback. Keep the design simple and welcoming, encouraging participants to share their thoughts. The form should be easy to fill out, with ratings sliders and open text boxes.

**Style Guide:**

The overall style should reflect the brand's values and manifesto. The look and feel should be modern, clean, and professional, reflecting the fast-paced, innovative nature of the workshop. Use the brand's color scheme consistently throughout the UI, with a generous use of white space to avoid clutter. Typography should be clear and legible, with a balance of bold headings for emphasis and simple, straightforward body text. Icons and graphics should be minimalistic and intuitive. 

This UI is designed to facilitate an efficient, productive, and enjoyable workshop experience, making the AI Innovation Day a memorable and impactful event for all participants.
